<li>Health systems-based studies: 0.03–0.1%</li>
<li>Survey-based studies of adults: 0.3–0.5% (transgender), 0.3–4.5% (all TGD)</li>

</ul>
<p>In the previous edition of its Standards of Care,
Version 7, World Professional Association for
Transgender Health (WPATH) identified only a
small number of articles attempting to estimate
the size of the transgender and gender diverse
(TGD) population and characterized the
state-of-the-science as “a starting point” requiring
further systematic study (Coleman et al., 2012).
Since then, the literature on this topic has
expanded considerably as evidenced by a number
of recent reviews that have sought to synthesize
the available evidence (Arcelus et al., 2015; Collin
et al., 2016; Goodman et al., 2019; Meier &amp;
Labuski, 2013; Zhang et al., 2020).</p>
<p>In reviewing epidemiologic data pertaining to
the TGD population, it may be best to avoid the
terms “incidence” and “prevalence.” Avoiding
these and similar terms may preclude inappropriate pathologizing of TGD people (Adams
et al., 2017; Bouman et al., 2017). Moreover, the
term “incidence” may not be applicable in this
situation because it assumes TGD status has an
easily identifiable time of onset, a prerequisite
for calculating incidence estimates (Celentano &amp;
Szklo, 2019). For all the above reasons, we recommend using the terms “number” and “proportion” to signify the absolute and the relative size
of the TGD population.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important consideration in
reviewing this literature is the variable definition
applied to the TGD population (Collin et al.,
2016; Meier &amp; Labuski, 2013). In clinic-based
studies, the data on TGD people are typically
limited to individuals who received
transgender-related diagnoses or counseling or
those who requested or underwent gender-affirming
therapy, whereas survey-based research typically
relies on a broader, more inclusive definition
based on self-reported gender identities.</p>
<p>Another methodological consideration in
assessing the size and distribution of the TGD
population is the need to understand what constitutes the sampling frame. As noted in recent
reviews (Goodman et al., 2019; Zhang et al.,
2020), many of the published studies, especially
those conducted more than a decade ago, first
assessed the number of patients seen at a particular clinical center and then divided that number
by an approximated population size. This was
unlikely to produce an accurate estimate because
the numerator in the calculations is not necessarily included in the denominator, and the true
size of the denominator often remains unknown.</p>
<p>With these considerations in mind, it is advisable to focus specifically on recent (published
within the last decade) peer-reviewed studies that
utilized sound methodology in identifying TGD
people within a well-defined sampling frame. For
all of the above reasons, the present chapter is
focused on studies that met the following inclusion criteria 1) appeared in press in 2009 or later;
2) used a clear definition of TGD status; 3) calculated proportions of TGD people based on a
well-defined population denominator; and 4)
were peer-reviewed. These types of studies can
provide more accurate contemporary estimates.</p>
<p>The available studies can be assigned into three
groups 1) those that reported proportions of TGD
people among individuals enrolled in large health
care systems; 2) those that presented results from
population surveys of predominantly adult participants; and 3) those that were based on surveys
of youth conducted in schools. Of these three
categories, the most informative and methodologically sound studies are summarized below.
Additional details about these and other similar
studies can be found in recent literature reviews
(Goodman et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Among studies that estimated the size of the
TGD population enrolled in large health care
systems, all were conducted in the US, and all
relied on information obtained from electronic
health records. Four of those health system-based
studies relied exclusively on diagnostic codes to
ascertain the TGD population; two studies
(Blosnich et al., 2013; Kauth et al., 2014) used
data from the Veterans Health Affairs system,
which provides care to over 9 million people,
and two studies (Dragon et al., 2017; Ewald et al.,
2019) used claims data from Medicare, the federal
health insurance program that primarily covers
people 65 years of age or older. The proportions
of TGD people reported in these diagnostic
code-based studies ranged from approximately
0.02% to 0.03%. Another more recent publication
also used Medicare data along with commercial
insurance claims to identify TGD people and
applied expanded inclusion criteria to supplement
diagnostic codes with information on procedures
and hormone therapy (Jasuja et al., 2020). Using
this methodology, the proportion of TGD people
among all persons enrolled in the participating
health plans was 0.03%. The sixth health
systems-based study (Quinn et al., 2017) was
conducted at Kaiser Permanente plans in the
states of Georgia and California; these plans provide care to approximately 8 million members
enrolled through employers, government programs, or individually. The TGD population in
the Kaiser Permanente study was ascertained
across all age groups using both diagnostic codes
and free-text clinical notes. The proportions of
TGD people identified at Kaiser Permanente were
higher than the corresponding proportions
reported in the Veterans Health Affairs and
Medicare studies with the most recent estimates
ranging from 0.04 to 0.08%.</p>
<p>In contrast to results from the health
system-based studies, findings from surveys that
relied on self-reported TGD status produced
much higher estimates. Two US studies took
advantage of the Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance Study (BRFSS), which is an annual
telephone survey conducted in all 50 states and
US territories (Conron et al., 2012; Crissman
et al., 2017). The first study used data from the
2007–2009 BRFSS cycles in the state of
Massachusetts, and the second study used the
2014 BRFSS data from 19 states and the territory
of Guam. Both studies reported that approximately 0.5% of adult participants (at least 18
years of age) responded <em>“Yes”</em> to the question <em>“Do
you consider yourself to be transgender?”</em></p>
<p>An internet-based survey administered to a
sample of the Dutch population 15–70 years of
age (Kuyper &amp; Wijsen, 2014) asked participants
to score the following two questions using a
5-point Likert scale: <em>“Could you indicate to which
degree you psychologically experience yourself as
a man?”</em> and <em>“Could you indicate to which degree
you psychologically experience yourself as a
woman?”</em> The respondents were considered “gender ambivalent” if they gave the same score to
both statements and “gender incongruent” when
they reported a lower score for their sex assigned
at birth than for their gender identity. The proportions of participants reporting incongruent
and ambivalent gender identity were 1.1% and
4.6%, respectively, for persons who were assigned
male at birth (AMAB), and 0.8% and 3.2%,
respectively, for persons assigned female at
birth (AFAB).</p>
<p>A similarly designed study estimated the proportion of TGD residents in the Flanders region
of Belgium using a sample drawn from the country’s National Register (Van Caenegem, Wierckx
et al., 2015). Participants were asked to score the
following statements: “I feel like a woman” and
“I feel like a man” on a 5-point Likert scale. Using
the same definitions applied in the Dutch study
(Kuyper &amp; Wijsen, 2014), the proportion of gender incongruent individuals was 0.7% for AMAB
people and 0.6% for AFAB people. The corresponding estimates for gender ambivalence among
AMAB and AFAB people were 2.2% and 1.9%,
respectively.</p>
<p>A more recent population-based study evaluated the proportion of TGD people among
approximately 50,000 adult residents of Stockholm
County, Sweden (Åhs et al., 2018). The numerator
was determined by asking participants the following question: “I would like hormones or surgery to be more like someone of a different sex.”
Two additional items were designed to identify
individuals experiencing gender incongruence: “I
feel like someone of a different sex” and “I would
like to live as or be treated as someone of a different sex.” The need for either hormone therapy
or gender-affirming surgery was reported by 0.5%
of participants. Individuals who expressed feeling
like someone of a different sex and those who
wanted to live as or be treated as a person of
another sex constituted 2.3% and 2.8% of the
total sample, respectively.</p>
<p>Population-based data outside of North
America and Western Europe are less common.
One recent study offers valuable data from a large
representative survey of 6,000 adults in Brazil
(Spizzirri et al., 2021). Gender identity of participants was assessed based on the following three
questions 1) <em>“Which of the following options best
describes how you currently feel?”</em> (Options: I feel
I am a man, I feel I am a woman, and I feel I
am neither a man nor a woman); 2) <em>“What is
the sex on your birth certificate?”</em> (Options: male,
female, and undetermined); and 3) <em>“Which of
these situations do you most closely relate to?”</em>
(Options: I was born male, but I have felt female
since childhood; I was born female, but I have
felt male since childhood; I was born male, and
I feel comfortable with my body; I was born
female, and I feel comfortable with my body).
Based on the responses to these three questions,
the authors determined 1.9% of the survey
respondents were TGD (0.7% defined as transgender, and 1.2% defined as nonbinary).</p>
<p>The literature on the population proportions
of TGD youth (persons under 19 years of age)
includes several survey studies conducted in
schools. A 2012 national cross-sectional survey
in New Zealand collected information on TGD
identity among high school students (Clark et al.,
2014). Among over 8,000 survey participants,
1.2% self-identified as TGD and 2.5% reported
they were not sure. Another study of schoolchildren was based on a 2016 survey of 9th and 11th
grade students (ages 14–18 years) in the US state
of Minnesota (Eisenberg et al., 2017). Of the
nearly 81,000 survey respondents, 2.7% reported
being TGD. A more recent study (Johns et al.,
2019) presented results of the Youth Risk Behavior
Survey (YRBS), which is conducted biennially
among local, state, and nationally representative
samples of US high school students in grades
9–12 (approximate age range 13–19 years). The
2017 YRBS cycle was carried out in 10 states and
9 large urban areas and included the following
sequence: <em>“Some people describe themselves as
transgender when their sex at birth does not match
the way they think or feel about their gender. Are
you transgender?<em>” Among nearly 120,000 participants across the 19 sites, 1.8% responded </em>“Yes,
I am transgender,”</em> and 1.6% responded <em>“I am not
sure if I am transgender.”</em></p>
<p>Another recently published school-based study
in the US presented results of a 2015 survey
conducted in Florida and California with the aim
of identifying gender diverse children and adolescents in a sample of just over 6,000 students
in grades 9–12 (Lowry et al., 2018). “High
gender-nonconforming” was used to define
AMAB children who reported being very/mostly/
somewhat feminine or AFAB children who
reported being very/mostly/somewhat masculine.
Based on these definitions, the proportions of
TGD participants were reported to be 13% among
AMAB students, 4% among AFAB students, and
8.4% overall.</p>
<p>Only one study examined the proportion of
self-identified TGD children in a younger age
group. Shields et al. analyzed the data from a
2011 survey of 2,700 students in grades 6–8 (age
range 11–13 years) across 22 San Francisco public
middle schools (Shields et al., 2013). Thirty-three
children self-identified as TGD based on the
question “What is your gender?” where the possible responses were “female, male, or transgender.” The resulting proportion of transgender
survey respondents was 1.3%. However, this definition would exclude TGD persons self-identifying
as nonbinary and those who do not explicitly
identify as transgender.</p>
<p>Taken together, these data indicate among
health system-based studies that relied on diagnostic codes or other evidence documented in
the medical records (Blosnich et al., 2013; Dragon
et al., 2017; Ewald et al., 2019; Kauth et al., 2014;
Quinn et al., 2017), the proportions of TGD people reported in recent years (2011–2016) ranged
from 0.02% to 0.08%. By contrast, when the TGD
status was ascertained based on self-report, the
corresponding proportions were orders of magnitude higher and reasonably consistent, if the
studies used similar definitions. When the surveys specifically inquired about “transgender”
identity, the estimates ranged from 0.3% to 0.5%
among adults and from 1.2% to 2.7% in children
and adolescents. When the definition was
expanded to include broader manifestations of
gender diversity, such as gender incongruence or
gender ambivalence, the corresponding proportions were higher: 0.5% to 4.5% among adults
and 2.5% to 8.4% among children and
adolescents.</p>
<p>As reviewed elsewhere (Goodman et al., 2019),
another noteworthy observation is the continuous
increase in both the size and the composition of
the TGD population with upward trends in the
proportion of TGD people observed in health
care systems, through population-based surveys,
as well as in the data on legal gender recognition.
The higher estimates observed in more recent
literature support some of the previous publications indicating the size of TGD population was
likely underestimated in earlier studies (Olyslager
&amp; Conway, 2008).</p>
<p>The temporal trends in AMAB to AFAB ratio
have also been reported in studies analyzing
referrals to clinics as well as data from integrated
health systems; this ratio has changed from predominantly AMAB in previous decades to predominantly AFAB in recent years, especially
among TGD youth (Aitken et al., 2015; de Graaf,
Carmichael et al., 2018; de Graaf, Giovanardi
et al. 2018; Steensma et al., 2018; Zhang et al.,
2021). The trend towards a greater proportion of
TGD people in younger age groups and the
age-related differences in the AMAB to AFAB
ratio likely represent the “cohort effect,” which
reflects sociopolitical advances, changes in referral
patterns, increased access to health care and to
medical information, less pronounced cultural
stigma, and other changes that have a differential
impact across generations (Ashley 2019d; Pang
et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Despite recent improvements in the quality of
published studies, an important limitation of the
existing literature is the relative paucity of
peer-reviewed publications from regions outside
of Western Europe or North America. Some of
the relevant information on global estimates can
be obtained from reports supported by the governments or non-governmental organizations
(Fisher et al., 2019; Kasianczuk &amp; Trofymenko,
2020), but these reports may be difficult to systematically identify and evaluate until they appear
in peer-reviewed literature. Other barriers to evaluating the global distribution of the TGD populations include inadequate access to demographic
data and over-representation of English-language
journals in the world literature.</p>
<p>These limitations notwithstanding, the available
highest-quality data clearly indicate TGD people
represent a sizable and growing proportion of the
general population. Based on the credible evidence available to date, this proportion may range
from a fraction of a percent to several percentage
points depending on the inclusion criteria, age
group, and geographic location. Accurate estimates of the proportion, distribution, and composition of the TGD population as well as a
projection of resources required to adequately
support the health needs of TGD people should
rely on systematically collected high-quality data,
which are now increasingly available. Continuous
and routine collection of these data is needed to
decrease variability and minimize over- and
under-estimation of the reported results. For
example, far more accurate and precise estimates
should become available when population censuses begin systematically collecting and reporting data on sex assigned at birth and gender
identity, including asexual and nonbinary categories, using the now well-validated two-step
method. The first such census-based estimate was
released by the national statistical office of
Canada. Based on the 2021 census data, 100,815
of 30.5 million Canadians self-identified as transgender or nonbinary; this accounted for 0.33%
of the population 15 years of age or older
(Statistics Canada, 2022). Consistent with the
published literature, the proportions of transgender and nonbinary people were much higher for
Generation Z (born between 1997 and 2006,
0.79%) and millennials (born between 1981 and
1996, 0.51%) than for Generation X (born
between 1966 and 1980, 0.19%), baby boomers
(born between 1946 and 1965, 0.15%), and the
Interwar and Greatest Generations (born in 1945
or earlier, 0.12%). While these results represent
the highest quality data available to date, it is
not clear how the population proportions reported
in Canada may compare with those in other
countries. The variability in the definitions of
what constitutes the TGD population and the
differences in data collection methods can be
reduced further by improving international
collaborations.</p>

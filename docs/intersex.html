<p>The Standards of Care, Version 7 included a chapter on the applicability of the standards to people
with physical intersexuality who become
gender-dysphoric and/or change their gender
because they differ from transgender individuals
without intersexuality in phenomenological presentation, life trajectories, prevalence, etiology, and
stigma risks. The current chapter provides an
update and adds recommendations on the medically necessary clinical approach to the management of individuals with intersexuality in general
(see medical necessity statement in Chapter 2—
Global Applicability, Statement 2.1). Because a newborn with an atypical sexual differentiation may
already present with clinical challenges, including
the need for family education and support from
early on, the decision-making on gender assignment, subsequent clinical gender management,
components of which—especially genital surgery—
may be controversial, and a later risk of gender
dysphoria development and gender change that is
markedly increased (Sandberg &amp; Gardner, 2022).</p>
<div id="terminology-2" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Terminology<a href="intersex.html#terminology-2" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>“Intersex” (from Latin, literal translation “between
the sexes”) is a term grounded in the binary
system of sex underlying mammalian (including
human) reproduction. In medicine, the term is
colloquially applied to individuals with markedly
atypical, congenital variations in the reproductive
tract. Some variations, often labeled “genital
ambiguity,” preclude the simple recognition of
somatic sex as male or female and, in resource-rich
societies, may require a comprehensive physical,
endocrine, and genetic work-up, before a sex/
gender is “assigned.” In recent years “intersex”
has also become an identity label adopted by
some individuals with intersex conditions and a
subset of (non-intersex) individuals with a nonbinary gender identity (Tamar-Mattis et al., 2018).</p>
<p>At a 2005 international consensus conference
on intersex management, intersex conditions were
subsumed under a new standard medical term,
“Disorders of Sex Development” (DSD), defined
as “congenital conditions in which development
of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is
atypical” (Hughes et al., 2006). DSD covers a
much wider range of conditions than those traditionally included under intersexuality and comprises conditions such as Turner syndrome and
Klinefelter syndrome, which are much more prevalent. In addition, many affected individuals dislike the term “disorder,” viewing it as inherently
stigmatizing (Carpenter, 2018; Griffiths, 2018;
Johnson et al., 2017; Lin-Su, et al., 2015; Lundberg
et al., 2018; Tiryaki et al., 2018). Health care professionals (HCPs) also vary in their acceptance
of the term (Miller et al., 2018). The wide-spread
alternative reading of DSD as “Differences in Sex
Development” can be seen as less pathologizing,
but is semantically unsatisfactory as this term
does not distinguish the typical genital differences
between males and females from atypical sexual
differentiation. Other recent attempts to come up
with less obviously stigmatizing terms such as
“Conditions Affecting Reproductive Development”
(CARD; Delimata et al., 2018) or “Variations of/
in Sex Characteristics” (VSC; Crocetti, et al.,
2021) are also not specific to intersexuality.</p>
<p>Given these definitional issues, in this chapter
we are using the term “intersexuality” (or “intersex”) to refer to congenital physical manifestations only. This is done for both descriptive
clarity and historical continuity. This choice is
not meant to indicate an intention on our part
to take sides in the ongoing discussion regarding
the concept of sex/gender as a bipolar system or
as a continuum, which may vary with considerations of context and utility (Meyer-Bahlburg,
2019). In 21st century societies, the concepts of
sex and gender are in a process of evolution.</p>
</div>
<div id="prevalence" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Prevalence<a href="intersex.html#prevalence" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The prevalence of intersex conditions depends
on the definition used. Obvious genital atypicality
(“ambiguous genitalia”) occurs with an estimated
frequency ranging from approximately 1:2000—
1:4500 people (Hughes et al., 2007). The most
inclusive definitions of DSD estimate a prevalence
of up to 1.7% (Blackless et al., 2000). Although
these numbers are high in aggregate, the individual conditions associated with the intersex
variations tend to be much rarer. For instance,
androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) occurs in
approximately 1 in 100,000 46,XY births (Mendoza
&amp; Motos, 2013), and classic congenital adrenal
hyperplasia (CAH) in approximately 1 in 15,000
46,XX births (Therrell, 2001). Prevalence figures
for individual syndromes may vary dramatically
between countries and ethnic groups.</p>
</div>
<div id="presentation" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Presentation<a href="intersex.html#presentation" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The presentation of individuals with intersex traits
varies widely. Intersexuality can be recognized
during prenatal ultrasound imaging, although most
individuals will be identified during genital examinations at birth. In resource-rich societies, such
children will undergo extensive medical diagnostic
procedures within the first weeks of life. Taking
into consideration the specific medical diagnosis,
physical and hormonal findings, and information
from long-term follow-up studies about gender
outcome, joint decision-making between the
health-care team and the parents generally leads
to the newborn being assigned to the male or
female sex/gender. Some individuals with intersexuality come to the attention of specialists only
around the age of puberty, for instance, when
female-raised adolescents are evaluated for primary
amenorrhea.</p>
<p>HCPs assisting individuals with both intersexuality and gender uncertainty need to be
aware that the medical context in which such
individuals have grown up is typically very different from that of non-intersex TGD people.
There are many different syndromes of intersexuality, and each syndrome can vary in its
degree of severity. Thus, hormonal and surgical
treatment approaches vary accordingly.</p>
<p>Some physical manifestations of intersexuality
may require early urgent intervention, as in cases
of urinary obstruction or of adrenal crisis in
CAH. Most physical variations among individuals
with intersexuality neither impair function, at
least in the early years, nor risk safety for the
individual. Yet, the psychosocial stigma associated
with atypical genital appearance often motivates
early genital surgery (commonly labeled ‘corrective’ or ‘normalizing’) long before the individual
reaches the age of consent. This approach is
highly controversial because it conflicts with ethical principles supporting a person’s autonomy
(Carpenter, 2021; Kon, 2015; National Commission
for the Protection of Human Subjects of
Biomedical and Behavioral Research, 1979). In
addition, among the manifestations without
immediate safety concerns, some individuals,
when older, may opt for a range of medical interventions to optimize function and appearance.
The specifics of medical treatments are far beyond
the scope of what can be addressed in this chapter, and the interested reader should consult the
respective endocrine and surgical literature.</p>
<p>Some intersex conditions are associated with a
greater variability in long-term gender identity outcome than others (Dessens et al., 2005). For instance,
the incidence of a non-cisgender gender identity in
46,XX individuals with CAH assigned female may
be as high as 5–10% (Furtado et al., 2012). The
substantial biological component underlying gender
identity is a critical factor that must be considered
when offering psychosocial, medical, and surgical
interventions for individuals with intersex conditions.</p>
<p>There is also ample evidence people with intersexuality and their families may experience psychosocial distress (de Vries et al., 2019;
Rosenwohl-Mack et al., 2020; Wolfe-Christensen
et al., 2017), in part related to psychosocial
stigma (Meyer-Bahlburg, Khuri et al., 2017;
Meyer-Bahlburg, Reyes-Portillo et al., 2017;
Meyer-Bahlburg et al., 2018).</p>

<div id="intersexuality-in-the-psychiatric-nomenclature" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Intersexuality in the psychiatric nomenclature<a href="intersex.html#intersexuality-in-the-psychiatric-nomenclature" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Since 1980, the American psychiatric nomenclature recognized individuals with intersexuality
who meet the criteria for gender identity variants;
however, their diagnostic categorization changed
with successive DSM editions. For instance, in
DSM-III (American Psychiatric Association,
1980), the Axis-I category of “transsexualism”
could not be applied to such individuals in adulthood, but such children were labeled “gender
identity disorder of childhood,” with the medical
intersex condition to be specified in Axis III. In
DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association,
2000), individuals with intersexuality were
excluded from the Axis-I category of “gender
identity disorder” regardless of age and, instead,
grouped with other conditions under the category
“gender identity disorder not otherwise specified.”
In DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association,
2013), which moved away from the multiaxial
system, “gender identity disorder” was re-defined
as “gender dysphoria” and applied regardless of
age and intersex status, but individuals with intersexuality received the added specification “with
a disorder of sex development” (Zucker et al.,
2013). The just published text revision of DSM-5
(American Psychiatric Association, 2022) keeps
the term gender dysphoria. Note, however, the
recent revision of the International Classification
of Diseases [ICD-11; World Health Organization,
2019a] has moved “gender incongruence” from
the chapter “Mental, B ehavioral, or
Neurodevelopmental Disorders” to a new chapter
“Conditions Related to Sexual Health.”</p>
<p>All the statements in this chapter have been
recommended based on a thorough review of
evidence, an assessment of the benefits and
harms, values and preferences of providers and
patients, and resource use and feasibility. In some
cases, we recognize evidence is limited and/or
services may not be accessible or desirable.</p>

<p>Intersexuality, a subcategory of DSD, is a complex congenital condition that requires the
involvement of experts from various medical and
behavioral disciplines (Hughes et al., 2006). Team
composition and function can vary depending on
team location, local resources, diagnosis, and the
needs of the individual with intersexuality and
her/his/their family. The ideal team includes pediatric subspecialists in endocrinology, surgery and/
or urology, psychology/psychiatry, gynecology,
genetics, and, if available, personnel trained in
social work, nursing, and medical ethics (Lee
et al., 2006). The structure of the team can be
in line with 1) the traditional multidisciplinary
medical model; 2) the interprofessional model;
or 3) the transdisciplinary model. Although these
structures can appear similar, they are in fact
very different and can exert varying influences
on how the team functions (Sandberg &amp; Mazur,
2014). The 2006 Consensus Statement makes no
decision about which model is best—multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, or transdisciplinary—
and only states the models “imply different
degrees of collaboration and professional
autonomy” (Lee, Nordenström et al., 2016). Since
the publication of the Consensus Statement in
2006, such teams have been created both in
Europe and in the US. A listing of teams in the
US can be found on the DSD-Translational
Network (DSD-TRN) website. There are also
teams in a number of European countries (Thyen
et al., 2018). While there are barriers to the creation of teams as noted by Sandberg and Mazur
(2014), multidisciplinary teams help address a
number of problems that have undermined the
successful care of individuals with an intersex
diagnosis and their families, such as the scattered
nature of services, the limited or absent communication between professionals, and the resulting
fragmented nature of the explanations individuals
receive that cause more confusion than clarity.</p>
<p>Most individuals born with intersexuality will
be identified at birth or shortly thereafter, while
others will be identified at later times in the life
cycle, for example at puberty (see Brain et al.,
2010, Table 1). When this happens the team
approach will be modified based on the diagnosis
and the age of the person. In some circumstances,
the composition of the team can be expanded to
include other specialists as needed.</p>
<p>It has been reported children seen by a multidisciplinary team were significantly more likely
to receive nearly the full range of services rather
than only those services offered by a single provider (Crerand et al., 2019). Parents who received
such care positively endorsed psychosocial services and the team approach and reported receiving more information than those who did not
interact with such a team (Crerand et al., 2019).</p>

<p>Results from interviews with medical trainees
(Liang et al., 2017; Zelin et al., 2018) and from
programmatic self-audits and surveys (DeVita
et al., 2018; Khalili et al., 2015) suggest medical
training programs are not adequately preparing
practitioners to provide competent care to individuals presenting with gender dysphoria and
intersexuality. Professional and stakeholder
attendees of intersex-specific events have identified ongoing education and collaboration as
an important professional development need
(Bertalan et al., 2018; Mazur et al., 2007). This
may be especially true for adult care providers
who may have less clinical guidance or support
in assisting those individuals who are transitioning from pediatric to adult care (Crouch &amp;
Creighton, 2014).</p>
<p>However, there are few guidelines for training
or assessing practitioner competency in managing
these topics, and those that are available primarily
apply to mental health professionals (MHPs)
(Hollenbach et al., 2014), with the exception of
a primary care guide (National LGBTQIA+Health
Education Center, 2020).</p>
<p>For HCPs wanting to improve their competency, seeking consultation from experts may be
an option when formal education or empirical
guidelines are otherwise unavailable. Given the
relative widespread adoption of multidisciplinary
expert teams in the treatment of intersexuality
(Pasterski et al., 2010), individuals serving on
these teams are well positioned to consult with
and educate other health care staff who may not
have received adequate training (Hughes et al.,
2006). Therefore, it is recommended the training
of other professionals be a central component of
team development (Auchus et al., 2010) and
members of multidisciplinary teams receive training specific to team-based work, including strategies for engaging in interprofessional learning
(Bisbey, et al., 2019; Interprofessional Education
Collaborative Expert Panel, 2011).</p>

<h2>Statement 10.3: We suggest health care professionals educate and counsel families of children with intersexuality from the time of diagnosis onward about the child’s specific intersex condition and its psychosocial implications.<a href="intersex.html#statement-10.3-we-suggest-health-care-professionals-educate-and-counsel-families-of-children-with-intersexuality-from-the-time-of-diagnosis-onward-about-the-childs-specific-intersex-condition-and-its-psychosocial-implications." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Full disclosure of medical information to families of children with intersex conditions through
education and counseling should begin at the time
of diagnosis and should be consistent with guidance from multiple international consensus guidelines. One of the most challenging issues presented
by a newborn with intersexuality, particularly
when associated with noticeable genital ambiguity,
is sex assignment and from the parents’ perspective, the gender of rearing (Fisher, Ristori et al.,
2016). Given this is a very stressful situation for
most parents, it is generally recommended the
decisions about sex/gender should be made as
quickly as a thorough diagnostic evaluation permits (Houk &amp; Lee, 2010). However, the criteria
for sex/gender decisions have changed over time.
In the second half of the 20th century, the decisions were biased towards female assignment,
because feminizing genital surgery was seen as
easier and less side-effect prone than masculinizing surgery. Yet, in certain intersex conditions, for
instance 46,XY 5α-RD-2 deficiency, female sex/
gender assignment was found to be associated with
high rates of later gender dysphoria and gender
change (Yang et al., 2010). Therefore, since the
International Consensus Conference on Intersex
Management in 2005, sex/gender assignment takes
into consideration the gradually accumulating data
on long-term gender outcome in the diverse conditions of intersexuality.</p>
<p>The practice of disclosure seeks to enable more
fully informed decision-making about care.
Additionally, while shame and stigma surrounding intersexuality is associated with poorer psychosocial outcomes, open and proactive
communication of health information has been
proposed as a strategy to reduce those risks (de
Vries et al., 2019). Depending on the person’s
diagnosis and developmental stage, intersex conditions may differentially impact individuals and
their health care needs. Intersex-health-related
communication must therefore be continuous and
tailored to the individual. Research on
decision-making in intersex care suggests families
are influenced by how clinical teams communicate (Timmermans et al., 2018). In keeping with
the SOC, we encourage providers to adopt normalizing, affirming language and attitudes across
education and counseling functions. For example,
describing genital atypia as a “variation” or “difference” is more affirming than using the terms
“birth defect” or “abnormality.”</p>
<p>All HCPs involved in an individual’s care can
provide essential education and information to
families. In multidisciplinary teams, the type of
education may align with an HCP’s area of
expertise, for example, a surgeon educating the
individual on their anatomy, an endocrinologist
teaching the specifics of hormonal development,
or an MHP conveying the spectrums of gender
and sexual identity. Other HCPs may need to
provide comprehensive education. Families
should receive information that is pertinent to
the individual’s specific intersex variation, when
known. All HCPs can supplement this information with patient-centered resources available
from support groups. People with intersexuality
have also been hired as team members to provide education using their lived experience.</p>
<p>Consensus guidelines also recommend families
be offered ongoing peer and professional psychosocial support (Hughes et al., 2006) that may
involve counseling with a focus on problem-solving
and anticipatory guidance (Hughes et al., 2006).
For example, families may seek guidance in educating other people—siblings, extended family,
and caregivers—about the specific intersex condition of an individual. Other families may need
support or mental health care to manage the
stress of intersex treatment. Adolescents may benefit from guidance on how to disclose information to peers as well as from support when
navigating dating and sex. Providing counseling
may also involve guiding families and individuals
of all ages through a shared decision-making process around medical or surgical care. Providers
may employ decision aids to support this process
(Sandberg et al., 2019; Weidler et al., 2019).</p>

<h2>Statement 10.4: We suggest both providers and parents engage children/individuals with intersexuality in ongoing, developmentally appropriate communications about their intersex condition and its psychosocial implications.<a href="intersex.html#statement-10.4-we-suggest-both-providers-and-parents-engage-childrenindividuals-with-intersexuality-in-ongoing-developmentally-appropriate-communications-about-their-intersex-condition-and-its-psychosocial-implications." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Communicating health information is a
multi-directional process that includes the transfer of information from providers to patients,
from parents to patients, as well as from patients
back to their providers (Weidler &amp; Peterson,
2019). While much emphasis has been placed on
communicating to parents around issues of diagnosis and surgical decision-making, youth with
DSD have reported barriers to engaging with
health care providers and may not always turn
to their parents for support (Callens et al., 2021).
To prepare individuals to be fully engaged and
autonomous in their treatment, it is critical both
providers and parents communicate continuously
with children/individuals.</p>
<p>Providers must set an expectation as soon as
possible for ongoing, open communication
between all parties, especially since parents may
experience distress due to the uncertainty associated with DSD and may seek quick fixes
(Crissman et al., 2011; Roberts et al., 2020).
Models of shared decision-making as well as
related decisional tools have been developed to
support ongoing communication between HCPs
and families/individuals (Karkazis et al., 2010;
Sandberg et al., 2019; Siminoff &amp; Sandberg, 2015;
Weidler et al., 2019). In addition to setting an
expectation for dialogue, providers can also set
the tone of communication. Providers can help
parents and individuals tolerate diagnostic uncertainty while simultaneously providing education
on anatomic variations, modeling openness to
gender and sexual identity, and welcoming the
child’s/individual’s questions. As they age, children/individuals may have questions or need
age-appropriate information on issues of sex,
menstruation, fertility, the need for hormone
treatment (adrenal/sex), bone health, and cancer risk.</p>
<p>Parents also play a critical role in educating
their children and may be the first people to
disclose health information to their child (Callens
et al., 2021). As part of expectation-setting around
communication, providers should prepare parents
to educate their child and members of their support system about the intersex diagnosis and
treatment history. Some parents report difficulties
in knowing how much to disclose to others as
well as to their own children (Crissman et al.,
2011; Danon &amp; Kramer, 2017). The stress parents
experience while raising children with an intersex
condition is increased when parents adopt an
approach that minimizes disclosure/discussion of
their child’s diagnosis (Crissman et al., 2011).
The level of stress also varies by developmental
stage, with parents of adolescents reporting higher
rates of stress (Hullman et al., 2011). Therefore,
HCPs should assist parents in developing strategies specific to their child’s developmental stage
that address their psychosocial or cultural concerns and values (Danon &amp; Kramer, 2017; Weidler
&amp; Peterson, 2019). Finally, broader research on
sexuality and gender variance has found—counter
to the associations between shame/stigma and
negative health outcomes—supportive family
behaviors (including talking with children about
their identity and connecting them with peers)
predicted greater self-esteem and better health
outcomes in individuals (Ryan et al., 2010).</p>

<p>Psychological, social, and cultural constructs
all intersect with biological factors to form an
individual’s gender identity. As a group, individuals with intersexuality show increased rates of
gender nonconforming behavior, genderquestioning, and cross-gender wishes in childhood, dependent in part on the discrepancy
between the prenatal sex-hormonal milieu in
which the fetal brain has differentiated and the
sex assigned at birth (Callens et al., 2016; Hines,
et al., 2015; Meyer-Bahlburg et al., 2016; Pasterski
et al., 2015). Gender identity problems are
observed at different rates in individuals with
different intersex conditions (de Vries et al.,
2007). More recently, some individuals have been
documented to develop a nonbinary identity, at
least privately (Kreukels et al., 2018). Although
the majority of people with intersexuality may
not experience gender dysphoria or wishes for
gender transition, they may still have feelings of
uncertainty and unanswered questions regarding
their gender (Kreukels et al., 2018). Questions
about gender identity may arise from such factors
as genital appearance, pubertal development, and
knowledge of items such as the diagnostic term
of the medical condition, gonadal status, sex
chromosome status, and a history of genital surgery. Therefore, HCPs need to be accessible for
clients to discuss such questions and feelings,
openly converse about gender diversity, and adopt
a less binary approach to gender. HCPs are
advised to guide parents as well in supporting
their children in exploring gender.</p>
<p>Furthermore, such support should not be confined to the childhood years. Rather, individuals
should be given the opportunity to explore their
gender identity throughout their lifetime, because
different phases may come with new questions
regarding gender (for example, puberty/adolescence, childbearing age). Children in general may
have questions regarding their gender identity at
salient points during their maturation and evolution. When faced with additional stressors, for
example, genital ambiguity, genital examinations
and procedures, as well as the intersectionality
of cultural bias and influences, individuals with
intersexuality may need support and should be
encouraged to seek educated professional assistance and guidance when needed. Also, HCPs
should inquire regularly to determine if their
clients with intersexuality need such support.
When people experience gender incongruence,
gender-affirming interventions may be considered. Procedures that should be applied in such
interventions are described in other chapters.</p>

<p>Individuals with intersexuality are reported to
experience stigma, feelings of shame, guilt, anger,
sadness and depression (Carroll et al., 2020;
Joseph et al., 2017; Schützmann et al., 2009).
Higher levels of psychological problems are
observed in this population than in the general
population (Liao &amp; Simmonds, 2014; de Vries
et al., 2019). In addition, parental fear of stigmatization and adjustment to their child’s diagnosis must not be overlooked by the clinical
team. Parents may benefit from supportive counseling to assist them both in managing clinical
decision-making (Fleming et al., 2017; Rolston
et al., 2015; Timmermans et al., 2019) as well as
understanding the impact of clinical decisions on
their view of their child (Crissman et al., 2011;
Fedele et al., 2010).</p>
<p>Thyen et al. (2005) found repeated genital
examinations appear to be correlated with shame,
fear and pain and may increase the likelihood of
developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
later in life (Alexander et al., 1997; Money &amp;
Lamacz, 1987). Exposure to repeated genital
examinations, fear of medical interventions, and
parental and physician secrecy about being intersex ultimately undermine the self-empowerment
and self-esteem of the person with intersexuality
(Meyer-Bahlburg et al., 2018; Thyen et al., 2005;
Tishelman et al., 2017; van de Grift, Cohen-Kettenis
et al., 2018). For recommendations on how to
conduct genital examinations to minimize adverse
psychological side effects see Tishelman
et al. (2017).</p>
<p>There is an active movement within the intersex community to alleviate stigma and to return
human rights and dignity to intersex people
rather than viewing them as medical anomalies
and curiosities (Yogyakarta Principles, 2007,
2017). Chase (2003) summarizes the major reasons for the intersex advocacy movement and
outlines how stigma and emotional trauma are
the outcome of ignorance and the perceived need
for secrecy. Public awareness of intersex conditions is very limited, and images and histories of
individuals with intersexuality are still presented
as “abnormalities of nature”. We, therefore, advise
HCPs to actively educate their colleagues, individuals with intersexuality, their families, and
communities, raise public awareness, and increase
knowledge about intersexuality. Societal awareness
and knowledge regarding intersexuality may help
reduce discrimination and stigmatization. Tools
and education/information materials may also
help individuals with intersexuality disclose their
condition, if desired (Ernst et al., 2016).</p>
<p>HCPs should be able to recognize and address
stigmatization in their clients (Meyer-Bahlburg
et al., 2018) and should encourage people with
intersexuality of various ages to connect via support groups. There is a need for developing specific techniques/methods for assisting clients to
cope with stigma related to intersex.</p>

<p>For almost all parents, the birth of a child with
intersexuality is entirely unexpected and comes as
a shock. Their inability to respond immediately
to the ubiquitous question, “Is your baby a boy
or a girl?”, their lack of knowledge about the
child’s condition, the uncertainty regarding the
child’s future, and the pervasive intersex stigma
are likely to cause distress, sometimes to the level
of PTSD and may lead to prolonged anxiety and
depression (Pasterski et al., 2014; Roberts et al.,
2020; Wisniewski &amp; Sandberg, 2015). This situation may affect parental care and long-term outcome of their child with intersexuality (Schweizer
et al., 2017). As these children grow up, they are
also at risk of experiencing intersex stigma in its
three major forms (enacted, anticipated, internalized) in all spheres of life (Meyer-Bahlburg et al.,
2018), along with other potential difficulties such
as body image problems, gender-atypical behavior,
and gender identity questioning. Many may face
the additional challenge presented by the awareness of the incongruence between their assigned
gender and biological characteristics such as sexual
karyotype, gonads, past and/or current
sex-hormonal milieu, and reproductive tract configuration. This situation may also adversely affect
the individuals’ mental health (Godfrey, 2021;
Meyer-Bahlburg, 2022). A recent online study of
a very large sample of LGBTQ youth indicated
that LGBTQ youth who categorized themselves as
having a physical intersex variation had a rate of
mental health problems that was higher than the
rate in LGBTQ youth without intersexuality
(Trevor Project, 2021). As intersex conditions are
rare, parents of such children and later the individuals themselves may experience their situation
as unique and very difficult for others to understand. Thus, based on clinical experience, there is
a consensus among HCPs who are experienced in
intersex care, that social support is a crucial component of intersex care, not only through professional support by MHPs (Pasterski et al., 2010),
but also, importantly, through support groups of
individuals with intersex conditions (Baratz et al.,
2014; Cull &amp; Simmonds, 2010; Hughes et al., 2006;
Lampalzer et al., 2021). A detailed international
listing of DSD and intersex peer support and
advocacy groups with their websites has been provided by Lee, Nordenström et al. (2016). Given
the heterogeneity of intersex conditions and treatment regimens, an individual with intersexuality
may find it most helpful to associate with a support group that includes members with the same
or similar condition as that of the individual. It
is important HCPs specializing in intersex care
also collaborate closely with such support groups
so that occasional differences in opinions regarding
specific aspects of care can be resolved through
detailed discussions. Close contacts between HCPs
and support groups also facilitate community-based
participatory research that benefits both sides.</p>

<p>While many people with intersexuality have a
gender identity in line with their XX or XY karyotype, there is sufficient heterogeneity that HCPs
should be able to provide customized approaches.
For example, among XX individuals with virilizing
CAH, a larger than expected minority have a male
gender identity (Dessens et al., 2005). Among XY
individuals with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome, gender identity can vary significantly (Babu
&amp; Shah, 2021). Furthermore, among XY individuals
with 5α-reductase-2 (5α-RD-2) deficiency and with
17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-3 deficiency
who are assigned the female sex at birth, a large
fraction (56–63% and 39–64%, respectively) change
from a typical female gender role to a typical male
gender role as they age (Cohen-Kettenis, 2005).</p>
<p>People with intersexuality have a wide range
of medical options open to them depending on
their gender identity and its alignment with anatomy. These options include puberty suppression
medication, hormonal treatment, and surgeries,
all customized to the unique circumstances of
the individual (Weinand &amp; Safer, 2015; Safer &amp;
Tangpricha, 2019) (for further information see
Chapter 6—Adolescents and Chapter 12—
Hormone Therapy). Specifically, when functional
gonads are present, puberty may be temporarily
suspended by using gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues. Such intervention can
facilitate the necessary passage of time needed
by the individual to explore gender identity and
to actively participate in sex designation, especially for conditions in which sex role change is
common (i.e., in female-raised individuals with
5α-RD-2 deficiency; Cocchetti, Ristori, Mazzoli
et al., 2020; Fisher, Castellini et al., 2016).
HCPs can counsel individuals and their families directly if the providers have sufficient
expertise and can leverage expertise needed to
determine both a course of treatment appropriate
for the individual and the logistics involved in
implementing the chosen therapeutic option.</p>

<h2>Statement 10.9: We suggest health care professionals counsel parents and children with intersexuality (when cognitively sufficiently developed) to delay gender-affirming genital surgery, gonadal surgery, or both, so as to optimize the children’s self-determination and ability to participate in the decision based on informed consent.<a href="intersex.html#statement-10.9-we-suggest-health-care-professionals-counsel-parents-and-children-with-intersexuality-when-cognitively-sufficiently-developed-to-delay-gender-affirming-genital-surgery-gonadal-surgery-or-both-so-as-to-optimize-the-childrens-self-determination-and-ability-to-participate-in-the-decision-based-on-informed-consent." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>International human rights organizations have
increasingly expressed their concerns that surgeries performed before a child can participate
meaningfully in decision-making may endanger
the child’s human rights to autonomy,
self-determination, and an open future (e.g.,
Human Rights Watch, 2017). Numerous medical
and intersex advocacy organizations as well as
several countries have joined these international
human rights groups in recommending the delay
of surgery when medically feasible (Dalke et al.,
2020; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering,
and Medicine, 2020). However, it is important to
note some anatomic variations, such as obstruction of urinary flow or exposure of pelvic organs,
pose an imminent risk to physical health
(Mouriquand et al., 2016). Others, such as menstrual obstruction or long-term malignancy risk
in undescended testes, have eventual physical
consequences. A third group of variations, i.e.,
variations in the appearance of external genitals
or vaginal depth, pose no immediate or long-term
physical risk. The above recommendation
addresses only those anatomic variations that, if
left untreated, have no immediate adverse physical consequences and where delaying surgical
treatment poses no physical health risk.</p>
<p>Non-urgent surgical care for individuals with
these variations is complex and often contested,
particularly when an individual is an infant or a
young child and cannot yet participate in the
decision-making process. Older people with intersexuality have reported psychosocial and sexual
health problems, including depression, anxiety,
and sexual and social stigma (de Vries et al.,
2019; Rosenwohl-Mack et al., 2020). Some studies
have suggested individuals with a specific variation (e.g., 46,XX CAH) agree with surgery being
performed before adolescence (Bennecke et al.,
2021). Recent studies suggest some adolescents
and adults are satisfied with the appearance and
function of the genitals after childhood surgery
(Rapp et al., 2021). A child’s genital difference
can also become a source of stress for parents,
and there is research that reports a correlation
of surgery to create binary genitals with a limited
amount of reduction in parental distress
(Wolfe-Christensen et al., 2017), although a
minority of parents may report decisional regret
(Ellens et al., 2017). Consequently, some organizations recommend surgery be offered to very
young children (American Urological Association,
2019; Pediatric Endocrine Society, 2020).</p>
<p>This shows the division within the medical
field regarding its management guidelines for
early genital surgery. The authors of this chapter
also did not reach complete consensus. Some
intersex specialists consider it potentially harmful
to insist on a universal deferral of early genital
surgery for genital variations without immediate
medical risks. Reasons supporting this view
include 1) intersex conditions are highly heterogeneous with respect to type and severity as well
as associated gonadal structure, function, and
malignancy risk; 2) societies and families vary
tremendously in gender norms and intersex
stigma potential; 3) early surgery may present
certain technical advantages; and 4) a review of
surveys of individuals with intersexuality (most
of whom had previously undergone genital surgery) show the majority endorse surgery before
the age of consent, especially in the case of individuals with 46,XX CAH and less strongly for
individuals with XY intersex conditions
(Meyer-Bahlburg, 2022). Experts supporting this
view call for an individualized approach to
decisions regarding genital surgery and its timing.
This approach has been adopted by medical societies with high rates of intersex specialists
(Bangalore Krishna et al., 2021; Pediatric
Endocrine Society, 2020; Speiser et al., 2018;
Stark et al., 2019) and by certain support organizations (CARES Foundation; Krege et al., 2019).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, long-term outcome studies are
limited and most studies reporting positive outcomes lack a non-surgical comparison group
(Dalke, et al., 2020; National Academies of
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2020). There
is also no evidence surgery protects children with
intersex conditions from stigma (Roen, 2019).
Adults with intersexuality do experience stigma,
depression, and anxiety related to their genitalia,
but can also experience stigma whether or not
they have surgery (Ediati et al., 2017;
Meyer-Bahlburg, Khuri et al., 2017; Meyer-Bahlburg
et al., 2018). There is also evidence surgeries may
lead to significant cosmetic, urinary, and sexual
complications extending into adulthood (Gong &amp;
Cheng, 2017; National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine, 2020). Recent studies
suggest some groups of individuals may have particularly negative experiences with gonadectomy,
although this risk has to be weighed against that
of gonadal malignancy (Duranteau et al., 2020;
Rapp et al., 2021). People with intersex conditions
are also far more likely than the general population to be transgender, to be gender diverse, or
to have gender dysphoria (Almasri et al., 2018;
Pasterski et al., 2015). Genital surgeries of young
children may therefore irreversibly reinforce a
binary sex assignment that is not aligned with
the persons’ future. These findings, together with
human rights perspectives, support the call for
the delay in the decision for surgery until the
individual can decide for him/her/themselves.</p>
<p>Systematic long-term follow-up studies are urgently
needed to compare individuals with the same intersex conditions who differ in the age at surgery or
have had no surgery with regard to gender identity,
mental health, and general quality of life.</p>

<p>Intersex conditions are rare, and intersex genital and gonadal anatomy are heterogeneous.
Surgeries have been associated with a risk of significant long-term complications (e.g., National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine,
2020), and most surgical training programs do
not prepare trainees to provide this specialized
care (Grimstad, Kremen et al., 2021). In recognition of the complexity of surgical care across
the lifespan, standards produced by expert and
international consensus recommend this care be
provided by multidisciplinary teams of experts
(Krege et al, 2019; Lee, Nordenström et al., 2016;
Pediatric Endocrine Society, 2020). Therefore, we
advise surgical care be limited to
intersex-specialized, multidisciplinary settings that
include surgeons experienced in intersex care.</p>

<p>Individuals with certain intersex conditions
may have reproductively functional genitalia but
experience infertility due to atypical gonadal
development. Others may have functioning
gonads with viable germ cells but an inability to
achieve natural fertility secondary to incongruent
internal or external genitalia (van Batavia &amp;
Kolon, 2016). Pubertal suppression, hormonal
treatment with sex steroid hormones, and gender
affirming surgeries may all have an adverse
impact on future fertility. The potential consequences of the treatment and fertility preservation
options should therefore be reviewed and
discussed.</p>
<p>Individuals with functioning testes should be
advised prolonged treatment with estrogen and
suppression of testosterone, as studied in TGD
people without intersexuality, may cause testicular
atrophy and a reduction in sperm count
(Mattawanon et al., 2018). Although interruption
of such gender affirming hormonal treatment
may improve sperm quality, a complete reversal
of semen impairment cannot be guaranteed
(Sermondade et al., 2021). The principal fertility
preservation option for individuals with functioning testes is cryopreservation of sperm collected
through masturbation or vibratory stimulation
(de Roo et al., 2016). Although there are no data
for success in humans, there is a proposal to
offer direct testicular extraction and cryopreservation of immature testicular tissue to adolescents
who have not yet undergone spermarche
(Mattawanon et al., 2018).</p>
<p>Individuals with functioning ovaries should be
advised testosterone therapy usually results in cessation of both menses and ovulation, often within
a few months of initiating therapy. There are major
gaps in knowledge regarding the potential effects
of testosterone on oocytes and subsequent fertility.
In transgender people, one study reported testosterone treatment may be associated with the development of polycystic ovarian morphology (Grynberg
et al., 2010). However, other researchers have not
found evidence of polycystic ovarian syndrome
(PCOS) among transgender men receiving gender
affirming hormone therapy based on metabolic
(Chan et al., 2018) or histologic parameters (de
Roo et al., 2017). Individuals with an intact uterus
and functioning ovaries may regain their fertility
potential if testosterone therapy is discontinued.</p>
<p>Fertility preservation options in post-pubertal
people with intersexuality and functioning ovaries
include hormonal stimulation for mature oocyte
cryopreservation or ovarian tissue cryopreservation. Alternatively, stimulated oocyte extraction
has been reported even for a transgender man
continuing testosterone therapy (Greenwald,
2021). Similarly, oocyte cryopreservation after
ovarian stimulation has been reported in a transgender boy receiving GnRHa therapy (Rothenberg
et al., 2019). It should be noted ovarian stimulation, temporary cessation of GnRHa, testosterone treatment, or both, as well as gynecological
procedures, can all be psychologically distressing
to individuals, with the stress reaction being
influenced by mental health, gender identity, and
other medical experience. Applicability of certain
interventions may depend on the support of other
people in the individual’s social network, including potential partners.</p>

<h2>Statement 10.12: We suggest health care professionals caring for individuals with intersexuality and congenital infertility introduce them and their families, early and gradually, to the various alternative options of parenthood.<a href="intersex.html#statement-10.12-we-suggest-health-care-professionals-caring-for-individuals-with-intersexuality-and-congenital-infertility-introduce-them-and-their-families-early-and-gradually-to-the-various-alternative-options-of-parenthood." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>For people with intersex characteristics, the
likelihood of infertility may be recognized in
infancy, childhood, adolescence as well as in
adulthood, without first engaging in attempts
to conceive. For many individuals, a diagnosis
of infertility accompanies the intersex diagnosis
(Jones, 2019). For some individuals, assisted
heterologous fertilization (e.g., oocyte or sperm
donation) may be an option. Multiple adoption
pathways exist. Some may require commitment
and a considerable investment of time.
Individuals who are either not interested in
engaging in the efforts to achieve fertility previously described or for whom fertility is not
possible can benefit from early exposure to the
options available for adoption and alternative
parenthood. While uterus transplantation has
had preliminary success in people with
Mullerian agenesis (Richards et al., 2021), there
is no protocol to date that avoids exposure of
the developing fetus to the risks associated with
the medications used to avoid transplant
rejection.</p>

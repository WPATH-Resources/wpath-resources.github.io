<p>These Standards of Care pertain to prepubescent
gender diverse children and are based on research,
ethical principles, and accumulated expert knowledge. The principles underlying these standards
include the following 1) childhood gender diversity
is an expected aspect of general human development (Endocrine Society and Pediatric Endocrine
Society, 2020; Telfer et al., 2018); 2) childhood
gender diversity is not a pathology or mental
health disorder (Endocrine Society and Pediatric
Endocrine Society, 2020; Oliphant et al., 2018;
Telfer et al., 2018); 3) diverse gender expressions
in children cannot always be assumed to reflect a
transgender identity or gender incongruence
(Ehrensaft, 2016; Ehrensaft, 2018; Rael et al.,
2019); 4) guidance from mental health professionals (MHPs) with expertise in gender care for children can be helpful in supporting positive
adaptation as well as discernment of gender-related
needs over time (APA, 2015; Ehrensaft, 2018;
Telfer et al., 2018); 5) conversion therapies for
gender diversity in children (i.e., any “therapeutic”
attempts to compel a gender diverse child through
words, actions, or both to identify with, or behave
in accordance with, the gender associated with the
sex assigned at birth are harmful and we repudiate
their use (APA, 2021; Ashley, 2019b, Paré, 2020;
SAMHSA, 2015; Telfer et al., 2018; UN Human
Rights Council, 2020).</p>
<p>Throughout the text, the term “health care
professional” (HCP) is used broadly to refer to
professionals working with gender diverse children. Unlike pubescent youth and adults, prepubescent gender diverse children are not eligible
to access medical intervention (Pediatric
Endocrine Society, 2020); therefore, when professional input is sought, it is most likely to be from
an HCP specialized in psychosocial supports and
gender development. Thus, this chapter is
uniquely focused on developmentally appropriate
psychosocial practices, although other HCPs, such
as pediatricians and family practice HCPs may
also find these standards useful as they engage
in professional work with gender diverse children
and their families.</p>
<p>This chapter employs the term “gender diverse”
given that gender trajectories in prepubescent
children cannot be predicted and may evolve over
time (Steensma, Kreukels et al., 2013). At the
same time, this chapter recognizes some children
will remain stable in a gender identity they articulate early in life that is discrepant from the sex
assigned at birth (Olson et al., 2022). The term,
“gender diverse” includes transgender binary and
nonbinary children, as well as gender diverse
children who will ultimately not identify as transgender later in life. Terminology is inherently
culturally bound and evolves over time. Thus, it
is possible terms used here may become outdated
and we will find better descriptors.</p>
<p>This chapter describes aspects of medical necessary care intended to promote the well-being
and gender-related needs of children (see medically necessary statement in the Global Applicability
chapter, Statement 2.1). This chapter advocates
everyone employs these standards, to the extent
possible. There may be situations or locations in
which the recommended resources are not fully
available. HCPs/teams lacking resources need to
work toward meeting these standards. However, if
unavoidable limitations preclude components of
these recommendations, this should not hinder
providing the best services currently available. In
those locations where some but not all recommended services exist, choosing not to implement
potentially beneficial care services risks harm to
a child (Murchison et al., 2016; Telfer et al., 2018;
Riggs et al., 2020). Overall, it is imperative to
prioritize a child’s best interests.</p>
<p>A vast empirical psychological literature indicates
early childhood experiences frequently set the stage
for lifelong patterns of risk and/or resilience and
contribute to a trajectory of development more or
less conducive to well-being and a positive quality
of life (Anda et al., 2010; Masten &amp; Cicchetti, 2010;
Shonkoff &amp; Garner, 2012). The available research
indicates, in general, gender diverse youth are at
greater risk for experiencing psychological difficulties (Ristori &amp; Steensma, 2016) than age- matched
cisgender peers as a result of encountering destructive experiences, including trauma and maltreatment
stemming from gender diversity-related rejection
and other harsh, non-accepting interactions (Barrow
&amp; Apostle, 2018; Giovanardi et al., 2018; Gower,
Rider, Brown et al., 2018; Grossman &amp; D’Augelli,
2006; Hendricks &amp; Testa, 2012; Reisner, Greytak
S68 E. COLEMAN ET AL.
et al., 2015; Roberts et al., 2014; Tishelman &amp;
Neumann-Mascis, 2018). Further, literature indicates
prepubescent children who are well accepted in
their gender diverse identities are generally
well-adjusted (Malpas et al., 2018; Olson et al.,
2016). Assessment and treatment of children typically emphasizes an ecological approach, recognizing
children need to be safe and nurtured in each setting they frequent (Belsky, 1993; Bronfenbrenner,
1979; Kaufman &amp; Tishelman, 2018; Lynch &amp;
Cicchetti, 1998; Tishelman et al., 2010; Zielinski &amp;
Bradshaw, 2006). Thus, the perspective of this chapter draws on basic psychological literature and
knowledge of the unique risks to gender diverse
children and emphasizes the integration of an ecological approach to understanding their needs and
to facilitating positive mental health in all gender
care. This perspective prioritizes fostering well-being
and quality of life for a child throughout their
development. Additionally, this chapter also
embraces the viewpoint, supported by the substantial psychological research cited above, that psychosocial gender-affirming care (Hidalgo et al., 2013)
for prepubescent children offers a window of opportunity to promote a trajectory of well-being that
will sustain them over time and during the transition to adolescence. This approach potentially can
mitigate some of the common mental health risks
faced by transgender and gender diverse (TGD)
teens, as frequently described in literature (Chen
et al., 2021; Edwards-Leeper et al., 2017; Haas et al.,
2011; Leibowitz &amp; de Vries, 2016; Reisner, Bradford
et al., 2015; Reisner, Greytak et al., 2015).</p>
<p>Developmental research has focused on understanding various aspects of gender development
in the earliest years of childhood based on a
general population of prepubescent children.
This research has typically relied on the assumption that child research participants are cisgender (Olezeski et al., 2020) and has reported
gender identity stability is established in the
preschool years for the general population of
children, most of whom are likely not gender
diverse (Kohlberg, 1966; Steensma, Kreukels
et al., 2013). Recently, developmental research
has demonstrated gender diversity can be
observed and identified in young prepubescent
children (Fast &amp; Olson, 2018; Olson &amp; Gülgöz,
2018; Robles et al., 2016). Nonetheless, empirical
study in this area is limited, and at this time
there are no psychometrically sound assessment
measures capable of reliably and/or fully ascertaining a prepubescent child’s self-understanding
of their own gender and/or gender-related needs
and preferences (Bloom et al., 2021). Therefore,
this chapter emphasizes the importance of a
nuanced and individualized clinical approach to
gender assessment, consistent with the recommendations from various guidelines and literature (Berg &amp; Edwards-Leeper, 2018; de Vries &amp;
Cohen-Kettenis, 2012; Ehrensaft, 2018; Steensma
&amp; Wensing-Kruger, 2019). Research and clinical
experience have indicated gender diversity in
prepubescent children may, for some, be fluid;
there are no reliable means of predicting an
individual child’s gender evolution
(Edwards-Leeper et al., 2016; Ehrensaft, 2018;
Steensma, Kreukels et al., 2013), and the
gender-related needs for a particular child may
vary over the course of their childhood.</p>
<p>It is important to understand the meaning of
the term “assessment” (sometimes used synonymously with the term “evaluation”). There are
multiple contexts for assessment (Krishnamurthy
et al., 2004) including rapid assessments that
take place during an immediate crisis (e.g., safety
assessment when a child may be suicidal) and
focused assessments when a family may have a
circumscribed question, often in the context of
a relatively brief consultation (Berg &amp;
Edwards-Leeper, 2018). The term assessment is
also often used in reference to “diagnostic assessment,” which can also be called an “intake” and
is for the purpose of determining whether there
is an issue that is diagnosable and/or could benefit from a therapeutic process. This chapter
focus on comprehensive assessments, useful for
understanding a child and family’s needs and
goals (APA, 2015; de Vries &amp; Cohen-Kettenis,
2012; Srinath et al., 2019; Steensma &amp;
Wensing-Kruger, 2019). This type of psychosocial
assessment is not necessary for all gender diverse
children, but may be requested for a number of
reasons. Assessments may present a useful
opportunity to start a process of support for a
gender diverse child and their family, with the
understanding that gender diverse children benefit when their family dynamics include
acceptance of their gender diversity and parenting guidance when requested. Comprehensive
assessments are appropriate when solicited by a
family requesting a full understanding of the
child’s gender and mental health needs in the
context of gender diversity.</p>
<p>In these circumstances, family member mental
health issues, family dynamics, and social and cultural contexts, all of which impact a gender diverse
child, should be taken into consideration (Barrow
&amp; Apostle, 2018; Brown &amp; Mar, 2018; Cohen-Kettenis
et al., 2003; Hendricks &amp; Testa, 2012; Kaufman &amp;
Tishelman, 2018; Ristori &amp; Steensma, 2016;
Tishelman &amp; Neumann-Mascis, 2018). This is further elaborated upon in the text below.</p>
<p>It is important HCPs working with gender
diverse children strive to understand the child and
the family’s various aspects of identity and experience: racial, ethnic, immigrant/refugee status,
religious, geographic, and socio-economic, for
example, and be respectful and sensitive to cultural
context in clinical interactions (Telfer et al., 2018).
Many factors may be relevant to culture and gender, including religious beliefs, gender-related
expectations, and the degree to which gender
diversity is accepted (Oliphant et al., 2018).
Intersections between gender diversity, sociocultural diversity, and minority statuses can be sources
of strength, social stress, or both (Brown &amp; Mar,
2018; Oliphant et al., 2018; Riggs &amp; Treharne, 2016).</p>
<p>Each child, family member, and family dynamic
is unique and potentially encompasses multiple
cultures and belief patterns. Thus, HCPs of all
disciplines should avoid stereotyping based on
preconceived ideas that may be incorrect or
biased (e.g., that a family who belongs to a religious organization that is opposed to appreciating
gender diversity will necessarily be unsupportive
of their child’s gender diversity) (Brown &amp; Mar,
2018). Instead, it is essential to approach each
family openly and understand each family member and family pattern as distinct.</p>

<p>HCPs working with gender diverse children

or regional accrediting bodies. We recognize the
specifics of credentialing and regulation of professionals vary globally. Importantly, basic licensure, certification, or both may be insufficient in
and of itself to ensure competency working with
gender diverse children, as HCPs specifically
require in-depth training and supervised experience in childhood gender development and gender diversity to provide appropriate care.</p>

<p>HCPs should receive training and supervised
expertise in general child and family mental
health across the developmental spectrum from
toddlerhood through adolescence, including
evidence-based assessment and intervention
approaches. Gender diversity is not a mental
health disorder; however, as cited above, we know
mental health can be adversely impacted for gender diverse children (e.g., through gender minority
stress) (Hendricks &amp; Testa, 2012) that may benefit
from exploration and support; therefore, mental
health expertise is highly recommended. Working
with children is a complex endeavor, involving
an understanding of a child’s developmental needs
at various ages, the ability to comprehend the
forces impacting a child’s well-being both inside
and outside the family (Kaufman &amp; Tishelman,
2018), and an ability to fully assess when a child
is unhappy or experiencing significant mental
health difficulties, related or unrelated to gender.
Research has indicated high levels of adverse
experiences and trauma in the gender diverse
community of children, including susceptibility
to rejection or even maltreatment (APA, 2015;
Barrow &amp; Apostle, 2018; Giovanardi et al., 2018;
Reisner, Greytak et al., 2015; Roberts et al., 2012;
Tishelman &amp; Neumann-Mascis, 2018). HCPs need
to be cognizant of the potential for adverse experiences and be able to initiate effective interventions to prevent harm and promote positive
well-being.</p>

<p>The experience of gender diversity in autistic
children as well as in children with other forms
of neurodivergence may present extra clinical
complexities (de Vries et al., 2010; Strang,
Meagher et al., 2018). For example, autistic children may find it difficult to self-advocate for
their gender-related needs and may communicate
in highly individualistic ways (Kuvalanka et al.,
2018; Strang, Powers et al., 2018). They may have
varied interpretations of gender-related experiences given common differences in communication and thinking style. Because of the unique
needs of gender diverse neurodivergent children,
they may be at high risk for being misunderstood
(i.e., for their communications to be misinterpreted). Therefore, professionals providing support to these children can best serve them by
receiving training and developing expertise in
autism and related neurodevelopmental presentations and/or collaborating with autism specialists (Strang, Meagher et al., 2018). Such training
is especially relevant as research has documented
higher rates of autism among gender diverse
youth than in the general population (de Vries
et al., 2010; Hisle-Gorman et al., 2019; Shumer
et al., 2015).</p>

<p>Continuing professional development regarding

<p>Continuing education includes 1) maintaining
up-to-date knowledge of available and relevant
research on gender development and gender
diversity in prepubescent children and gender
diversity across the life span; 2) maintaining current knowledge regarding best practices for
assessment, support, and treatment approaches
with gender diverse children and families. This
is a relatively new area of practice and health
care professionals need to adapt as new information emerges through research and other avenues
(Bartholomaeus et al., 2021).</p>

<p>A comprehensive assessment, when requested
by a family and/or an HCP can be useful for
developing intervention recommendations, as
needed, to benefit the well-being of the child and
other family members. Such an assessment can be
beneficial in a variety of situations when a child
and/or their family/guardians, in coordination with
providers, feel some type of intervention would
be helpful. Neither assessments nor interventions
should ever be used as a means of covertly or
overtly discouraging a child’s gender diverse
expressions or identity. Instead, with appropriately
trained providers, assessment can be an effective
means of better understanding how to support a
child and their family without privileging any particular gender identity or expression. An assessment can be especially important for some children
and their families by collaborating to promote a
child’s gender health, well-being, and self-fulfillment.</p>
<p>A comprehensive assessment can facilitate the
formation of an individualized plan to assist a
gender diverse prepubescent children and family
members (de Vries &amp; Cohen-Kettenis, 2012;
Malpas et al., 2018; Steensma &amp; Wensing-Kruger,
2019; Telfer et al., 2018; Tishelman &amp; Kaufman,
2018). In such an assessment, integrating information from multiple sources is important to 1)
best understand the child’s gender needs and
make recommendations; and 2) identify areas of
child, family/caregiver, and community strengths
and supports specific to the child’s gender status
and development as well as risks and concerns
for the child, their family/caregivers and environment. Multiple informants for both evaluation
and support/intervention planning purposes may
include the child, parents/caregivers, extended
family members, siblings, school personnel, HCPs,
the community, broader cultural and legal contexts and other sources as indicated (Berg &amp;
Edwards-Leeper, 2018; Srinath, 2019).</p>
<p>An HCP conducting an assessment of gender
diverse children needs to explore gender-related
issues but must also take a broad view of the
child and the environment, consistent with the
ecological model described above
(Bronfenbrenner, 1979) to fully understand the
factors impacting a child’s well-being and areas
of gender support and risk (Berg &amp;
Edwards-Leeper, 2018; Hendricks &amp; Testa, 2012;
Kaufman &amp; Tishelman, 2018; Tishelman &amp;
Neumann-Mascis, 2018). This includes understanding the strengths and challenges experienced by the child/family and that are present
in the environment. We advise HCPs conducting
an assessment with gender diverse children to
consider incorporating multiple assessment
domains, depending on the child and the family’s needs and circumstances. Although some
of the latter listed domains below do not directly
address the child’s gender (see items 7–12
below), they need to be accounted for in a gender assessment, as indicated by clinical judgment, to understand the complex web of factors
that may be affecting the child’s well-being in
an integrated fashion, including gender health,
consistent with evaluation best practices a (APA,
2015; Berg &amp; Edwards-Leeper, 2018; Malpas
et al., 2018) and develop a multi-pronged intervention when needed.</p>
<p>Summarizing from relevant research and clinical
expertise, assessment domains often include 1) a
child’s asserted gender identity and gender expression, currently and historically; 2) evidence of
dysphoria, gender incongruence, or both; 3)
strengths and challenges related to the child, family, peer and others’ beliefs and attitudes about
gender diversity, acceptance and support for child;
4) child and family experiences of gender minority
stress and rejection, hostility, or both due to the
child’s gender diversity; 5) level of support related
to gender diversity in social contexts (e.g., school,
faith community, extended family); 6) evaluation
of conflict regarding the child’s gender and/or
parental/caregiver/sibling concerning behavior
related to the child’s gender diversity; 7) child
mental health, communication and/or cognitive
strengths and challenges, neurodivergence, and/or
behavioral challenges causing significant functional
difficulty; 8) relevant medical and developmental
history; 9) areas that may pose risks (e.g., exposure
to domestic and/or community violence, any form
of child maltreatment; history of trauma; safety
and/or victimization with peers or in any other
setting; suicidality); 10) co-occurring significant
family stressors, such as chronic or terminal illness, homelessness or poverty; 11) parent/caregiver
and/or sibling mental health and/or behavioral
challenges causing significant functional difficulty;
and 12) child’s and family’s strengths and challenges.</p>
<p>A thorough assessment incorporating multiple
forms of information gathering is helpful for
understanding the needs, strengths, protective
factors, and risks for a specific child and family
across environments (e.g., home/school). Methods
of information gathering often include 1) interviews with the child, family members and others
(e.g., teachers), structured and unstructured; 2)
caregiver and child completed standardized measures related to gender; general child well-being;
child cognitive and communication skills and
developmental disorders/disabilities; support and
acceptance by parent/caregiver, sibling, extended
family and peers; parental stress; history of childhood adversities; and/or other issues as appropriate (APA, 2020; Berg &amp; Edwards-Leeper, 2018;
Kaufman &amp; Tishelman, 2018; Srinath, 2019).</p>
<p>Depending on the family characteristics, the
developmental profile of the child, or both, methods of information gathering also may also benefit
from including the following 1) child and/or family observation, structured and unstructured; and
2) structured and visually supported assessment
techniques (worksheets; self-portraits; family drawings, etc.) (Berg &amp; Edwards-Leeper, 2018).</p>

<p>Given the complexities of assessing young
children who, unlike adults, are in the process
of development across a range of domains (cognitive, social, emotional, physiological), it is
important to consider the developmental status
of a child and gear assessment modalities and
interactions to the individualized abilities of the
child. This includes tailoring the assessment to
a child’s developmental stage and abilities (preschoolers, school age, early puberty prior to
adolescence), including using language and
assessment approaches that prioritize a child’s
comfort, language skills, and means of
self-expression (Berg &amp; Edwards-Leeper, 2018;
Srinath, 2019). For example, relevant developmental factors, such as neurocognitive differences (e.g., autism spectrum conditions), and
receptive and expressive language skills should
be considered in conducting the assessment.
Health care professionals may need to consult
with specialists for guidance in cases in which
they do not possess the specialized skills themselves (Strang et al., 2021).</p>

<p>HCPs conducting an assessment with gender
diverse children and families need to account for
developmental, emotional, and environmental factors that may constrain a child’s, caregiver’s, sibling or other’s report or influence their belief
systems related to gender (Riggs &amp; Bartholomaeus,
2018). As with all child psychological assessments, environmental and family/caregiver reactions (e.g., punishment), and/or cognitive and
social factors may influence a child’s comfort
and/or ability to directly discuss certain factors,
including gender identity and related issues
(Srinath, 2019). Similarly, family members may
feel constrained in freely expressing their concerns and ideas depending on family conflicts or
dynamics and/or other influences (e.g., cultural/
religious; extended family pressure) (Riggs &amp;
Bartholomaeus, 2018).</p>

<p>The goal of psychotherapy should never be aimed
at modifying a child’s gender identity (APA, 2021;
Ashley, 2019b; Paré, 2020; SAMHSA, 2015; UN
Human Rights Council, 2020), either covertly or
overtly. Not all gender diverse children or their
families need input from MHPs as gender diversity
is not a mental health disorder (Pediatric Endocrine
Society, 2020; Telfer et al., 2018). Nevertheless, it is
often appropriate and helpful to seek psychotherapy
when there is distress or concerns are expressed by
parents to improve psychosocial health and prevent
further distress (APA, 2015). Some of the common
reasons for considering psychotherapy for a gender
diverse child and family include the following 1)
A child is demonstrating significant conflicts, confusion, stress or distress about their gender identity
or needs a protected space to explore their gender
(Ehrensaft, 2018; Spivey and Edwards-Leeper, 2019);
2) A child is experiencing external pressure to
express their gender in a way that conflicts with
their self-knowledge, desires, and beliefs (APA,
2015); 3) A child is struggling with mental health
concerns, related to or independent of their gender
(Barrow &amp; Apostle, 2018); 4) A child would benefit
from strengthening their resilience in the face of
negative environmental responses to their gender
identity or presentation (Craig &amp; Auston, 2018;
Malpas et al., 2018); 5) A child may be experiencing
mental health and/or environmental concerns,
including family system problems that can be misinterpreted as gender congruence or incongruence
(Berg &amp; Edwards-Leeper, 2018); and 6) A child
expresses a desire to meet with an MHP to get
gender-related support. In these situations, the psychotherapy will focus on supporting the child with
the understanding that the child’s parent(s)/caregiver(s) and potentially other family members will
be included as necessary (APA, 2015; Ehrensaft,
2018; McLaughlin &amp; Sharp, 2018). Unless contraindicated, it is extremely helpful for parents/guardians to participate in some capacity in the
psychotherapy process involving prepubescent children as family factors are often central to a child’s
well-being. Although relatively unexplored in
research involving gender diverse children, it may
be important to attend to the relationship between
siblings and the gender diverse child (Pariseau
et al., 2019; Parker &amp; Davis-McCabe, 2021).</p>
<p>HCPs should employ interventions tailor-made
to the individual needs of the child that are
designed to 1) foster protective social and emotional coping skills to promote resilience in the
face of potential negative reactions to the child’s
gender identity, expressions, or both (Craig &amp;
Austin, 2016; Malpas et al., 2018; Spencer, Berg
et al., 2021); 2) collaboratively problem-solve
social challenges to reduce gender minority stress
(Barrow &amp; Apostle, 2018; Tishelman &amp;
Neumann-Mascis, 2018); 3) strengthen environmental supports for the child and/or members of
the immediate and extended family (Kaufman &amp;
Tishelman, 2018); and 4) provide the child an
opportunity to further understand their internal
gender experiences (APA, 2015; Barrow&amp; Apostle,
2018; Ehrensaft, 2018; Malpas et al., 2018;
McLaughlin &amp; Sharp, 2018). It is helpful for HCPs
to develop a relationship with a gender diverse
child and family that can endure over time as
needed. This enables the child/family to establish
a long-term trusting relationship throughout
childhood whereby the HCP can offer support
and guidance as a child matures and as potentially</p>
<p>different challenges or needs emerge for the child/
family (Spencer, Berg et al., 2021; Murchison
et al., 2016). In addition to the above and within
the limits of available resources, when a child is
neurodivergent, an HCP who has the skill set to
address both neurodevelopmental differences and
gender is most appropriate (Strang et al., 2021).</p>
<p>As outlined in the literature, there are numerous reasons parents/caregivers, siblings, and
extended family members of a prepubescent child
may find it useful to seek psychotherapy for
themselves (Ehrensaft, 2018; Malpas et al., 2018;
McLaughlin &amp; Sharp, 2018). As summarized
below, some of these common catalysts for seeking such treatment occur when one or more family members 1) desire education around gender
development (Spivey &amp; Edwards-Leeper, 2019);
2) are experiencing significant confusion or stress
about the child’s gender identity, expression, or
both (Ashley, 2019c; Ehrensaft, 2018); 3) need
guidance related to emotional and behavioral
concerns regarding the gender diverse child
(Barrow &amp; Apostle, 2018; 4) need support to
promote affirming environments outside of the
home (e.g., school, sports, camps) (Kaufman &amp;
Tishelman, 2018); 5) are seeking assistance to
make informed decisions about social transition,
including how to do so in a way that is optimal
for a child’s gender development and health (Lev
&amp; Wolf-Gould, 2018); 6) are seeking guidance
for dealing with condemnation from others,
including political entities and accompanying legislation, regarding their support for their gender
diverse child (negative reactions directed toward
parents/caregivers can sometimes include rejection and/or harassment/abuse from the social
environment arising from affirming decisions
(Hidalgo &amp; Chen, 2019); 7) are seeking to process
their own emotional reactions and needs about
their child’s gender identity, including grief about
their child’s gender diversity and/or potential
fears or anxieties for their child’s current and
future well-being (Pullen Sansfaçon et al., 2019);
and 8) are emotionally distressed and/or in conflict with other family members regarding the
child’s gender diversity (as needed, HCPs can
provide separate sessions for parents/caregivers,
siblings and extended family members for support, guidance, and/or psychoeducation)
(McLaughlin &amp; Sharp, 2018; Pullen Sansfaçon
et al., 2019; Spivey &amp; Edwards-Leeper, 2019).</p>

<p>Consistent with the ecological model described
above and, as appropriate, based on individual/
family circumstances, it can be extremely helpful
for HCPs to prioritize coordination with important others (e.g., teachers, coaches, religious leaders) in a child’s life to promote emotional and
physical safety across settings (e.g., school settings, sports and other recreational activities,
faith-based involvement) (Kaufman &amp; Tishelman,
2018). Therapeutic and/or support groups are
often recommended as a valuable resource for
families/caregivers and/or gender diverse children
themselves (Coolhart, 2018; Horton et al., 2021;
Malpas et al., 2018; Murchison et al., 2016).</p>

<p>Parents/caregivers and their gender diverse child
should have the opportunity to develop knowledge
regarding ways in which families/caregivers can
best support their child to maximize resilience,
self-awareness, and functioning (APA, 2015;
Ehrensaft, 2018; Malpas, 2018; Spivey &amp;
Edwards-Leeper, 2019). It is neither possible nor
is it the role of the HCP to predict with certainty
the child’s ultimate gender identity; instead, the
HCP’s task is to provide a safe space for the child’s
identity to develop and evolve over time without
attempts to prioritize any particular developmental
trajectory with regard to gender (APA, 2015;
Spivey &amp; Edwards-Leeper, 2019). Gender diverse
children and early adolescents have different needs
and experiences than older adolescents, socially
and physiologically, and those differences should
be reflected in the individualized approach HCPs
provide to each child/family (Keo-Meir &amp;
Ehrensaft, 2018; Spencer, Berg et al., 2021).</p>
<p>Parents/caregivers and their children should
also have the opportunity to develop knowledge
about gender development and gender literacy
through age-appropriate psychoeducation (Berg
&amp; Edwards-Leeper, 2018; Rider, Vencill et al.,
2019; Spencer, Berg et al., 2021). Gender literacy
involves understanding the distinctions between
sex designated at birth, gender identity, and gender expression, including the ways in which these
three factors uniquely come together for a child
(Berg &amp; Edwards-Leeper, 2018; Rider, Vencill
et al., 2019; Spencer, Berg et al., 2021). As a child
gains gender literacy, they begin to understand
their body parts do not necessarily define their
gender identity and/or their gender expression
(Berg &amp; Edwards-Leeper, 2018; Rider, Vencill
et al., 2019; Spencer, Berg et al., 2021). Gender
literacy also involves learning to identify messages
and experiences related to gender within society.
As a child gains gender literacy, they may view
their developing gender identity and gender
expression more positively, promoting resilience
and self-esteem, and diminishing risk of shame
in the face of negative messages from the environment. Gaining gender literacy through psychoeducation may also be important for siblings
and/or extended family members who are important to the child (Rider, Vencill et al., 2019;
Spencer, Berg et al., 2021).</p>

<p>As a child matures and approaches puberty,
HCPs should prioritize working with children and
their parents/caregivers to integrate psychoeducation about puberty, engage in shared
decision-making about potential gender-affirming
medical interventions, and discuss fertility-related
and other reproductive health implications of
medical treatments (Nahata, Quinn et al., 2018;
Spencer, Berg et al., 2021). Although only limited
empirical research exists to evaluate such interventions, expert consensus and developmental
psychological literature generally support the
notion that open communication with children
about their bodies and preparation for physiological changes of puberty, combined with
gender-affirming acceptance, will promote resilience and help to foster positive sexuality as a
child matures into adolescence (Spencer, Berg
et al., 2019). All these discussions may be extended
(e.g., starting earlier) to include neurodivergent
children, to ensure there is enough time for
reflection and understanding, especially as choices
regarding future gender- affirming medical care
potentially arise (Strang, Jarin et al., 2018). These
discussions could include the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review of body parts and their different functions;</li>
<li>The ways in which a child’s body may change over time with and without medical intervention;</li>
<li>The impact of medical interventions on later sexual functioning and fertility;</li>
<li>The impact of puberty suppression on potential later medical interventions;</li>
<li>Acknowledgment of the current lack ofclinical data in certain areas related to the impacts of puberty suppression;</li>
<li>The importance of appropriate sex education prior to puberty.</li>
</ul>
<p>These discussions should employ developmentally appropriate language and teaching styles,
and be geared to the specific needs of each individual child (Spencer, Berg et al., 2021).</p>

<p>Gender social transition refers to a process by
which a child is acknowledged by others and has
the opportunity to live publicly, either in all situations or in certain situations, in the gender
identity they affirm and has no singular set of
parameters or actions (Ehrensaft et al., 2018).</p>
<p>Gender social transition has often been conceived in the past as binary—a girl transitions to
a boy, a boy to a girl. The concept has expanded
to include children who shift to a nonbinary or
individually shaped iteration of gender identity
(Chew et al., 2020; Clark et al., 2018). Newer
research indicates the social transition process may
serve a protective function for some prepubescent
children and serve to foster positive mental health
and well-being (Durwood et al., 2017; Gibson
et al., 2021; Olson et al., 2016). Thus, recognition
that a child’s gender may be fluid and develop
over time (Edwards-Leeper et al., 2016; Ehrensaft,
2018; Steensma, Kreukels et al., 2013) is not sufficient justification to negate or deter social transition for a prepubescent child when it would be
beneficial. Gender identity evolution may continue
even after a partial or complete social transition
process has taken place (Ashley, 2019e;
Edwards-Leeper et al., 2018; Ehrensaft, 2020;
Ehrensaft et al., 2018; Spivey &amp; Edwards-Leeper,
2019). Although empirical data remains limited,
existing research has indicated children who are
most assertive about their gender diversity are
most likely to persist in a diverse gender identity
across time, including children who socially transition prior to puberty (Olson et al., 2022; Rae
et al., 2019; Steensma, McGuire et al., 2013). Thus,
when considering a social transition, we suggest
parents/caregivers and HCPs pay particular attention to children who consistently and often persistently articulate a gender identity that does not
match the sex designated at birth. This includes
those children who may explicitly request or desire
a social acknowledgement of the gender that better
matches the child’s articulated gender identity and/
or children who exhibit distress when their gender
as they know it is experienced as incongruent with
the sex designated at birth (Rae et al., 2019;
Steensma, Kreukels et al., 2013).</p>
<p>Although there is a dearth of empirical literature regarding best practices related to the social
transition process, clinical literature and expertise
provides the following guidance that prioritizes
a child’s best interests (Ashley, 2019e; Ehrensaft,
2018; Ehrensaft et al, 2018; Murchison et al.,
2016; Telfer et al., 2018): 1) social transition
should originate from the child and reflect the
child’s wishes in the process of making the
decision to initiate a social transition process; 2)
an HCP may assist exploring the advantages/benefits, plus potential challenges of social transition;
3) social transition may best occur in all or in
specific contexts/settings only (e.g., school, home);
and 4) a child may or may not choose to disclose
to others that they have socially transitioned, or
may designate, typically with the help of their
parents/caregivers, a select group of people with
whom they share the information.</p>
<p>In summary, social transition, when it takes
place, is likely to best serve a child’s well-being
when it takes place thoughtfully and individually
for each child. A child’s social transition (and
gender as well) may evolve over time and is not
necessarily static, but best reflects the cross-section
of the child’s established self-knowledge of their
present gender identity and desired actions to
express that identity (Ehrensaft et al., 2018).</p>
<p>A social transition process can include one or
more of a number of different actions consistent
with a child’s affirmed gender (Ehrensaft et al.,
2018), including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name change;</li>
<li>Pronoun change;</li>
<li>Change in sex/gender markers (e.g., birth certificate; identification cards; passport; school and medical documentation; etc.);</li>
<li>Participation in gender-segregated programs (e.g., sports teams; recreational clubs and camps; schools; etc.);</li>
<li>Bathroom and locker room use;</li>
<li>Personal expression (e.g., hair style; clothing choice; etc.);</li>
<li>Communication of affirmed gender to others (e.g., social media; classroom or school announcements; letters to extended families or social contacts; etc.).</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important children who have engaged in
social transition be afforded the same opportunities as other children to continue considering
meanings and expressions of gender throughout
their childhood years (Ashley 2019e; Spencer,
Berg et al., 2021). Some research has found children may experience gender fluidity or even
detransition after an initial social transition.
Research has not been conclusive about when in
the life span such detransition is most likely to
occur, or what percentage of youth will eventually
experience gender fluidity and/or a desire to
detransition—due to gender evolution, or potentially other reasons (e.g., safety concerns; gender
minority stress) (Olson et al., 2022; Steensma,
Kreukels et al., 2013). A recent research report
indicates in the US, detransition occurs with only
a small percentage of youth five years after a
binary social transition (Olson et al., 2022); further follow-up of these young people would be
helpful. Replication of these findings is important
as well since this study was conducted with a
limited and self-selected participant pool in the
US and thus may not be applicable to all gender
diverse children. In summary, we have limited
ability to know in advance the ways in which a
child’s gender identity and expressions may evolve
over time and whether or why detransition may
take place for some. In addition, not all gender
diverse children wish to explore their gender
(Telfer et al., 2018). Cisgender children are not
expected to undertake this exploration, and therefore attempts to force this with a gender diverse
child, if not indicated or welcomed, can be experienced as pathologizing, intrusive and/or cisnormative (Ansara &amp; Hegarty, 2012; Bartholomaeus
et al., 2021; Oliphant et al., 2018).</p>

<h2>Statement 7.14: We recommend health care professionals discuss the potential benefits and risks of a social transition with families who are considering it.<a href="children.html#statement-7.14-we-recommend-health-care-professionals-discuss-the-potential-benefits-and-risks-of-a-social-transition-with-families-who-are-considering-it." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Social transition in prepubescent children consists of a variety of choices, can occur as a process over time, is individualized based on both
a child’s wishes and other psychosocial considerations (Ehrensaft, 2018), and is a decision for
which possible benefits and challenges should be
weighted and discussed.</p>
<p>A social transition may have potential benefits
as outlined in clinical literature (e.g., Ehrensaft
et al., 2018) and supported by research (Fast &amp;
Olson, 2018; Rae et al., 2019). These include
facilitating gender congruence while reducing
gender dysphoria and enhancing psychosocial
adjustment and well-being (Ehrensaft et al., 2018).
Studies have indicated socially transitioned gender diverse children largely mirror the mental
health characteristics of age matched cisgender
siblings and peers (Durwood et al., 2017). These
findings differ markedly from the mental health
challenges consistently noted in prior research
with gender diverse children and adolescents
(Barrow &amp; Apostle, 2018) and suggest the impact
of social transition may be positive. Additionally,
social transition for children typically can only
take place with the support and acceptance of
parents/caregivers, which has also been demonstrated to facilitate well-being in gender diverse
children (Durwood et al., 2021; Malpas et al.,
2018; Pariseau et al., 2019), although other forms
of support, such as school-based support, have
also been identified as important (Durwood
et al., 2021; Turban, King et al., 2021). HCPs
should discuss the potential benefits of a social
transition with children and families in situations
in which 1) there is a consistent, stable articulation of a gender identity that is incongruent with
the sex assigned at birth (Fast &amp; Olson, 2018).
This should be differentiated from gender diverse
expressions/behaviors/interests (e.g., playing with
toys, expressing oneself through clothing or
appearance choices, and/or engaging in activities
socially defined and typically associated with the
other gender in a binary model of gender)
(Ehrensaft, 2018; Ehrensaft et al., 2018); 2) the
child is expressing a strong desire or need to
transition to the gender they have articulated as
being their authentic gender (Ehrensaft et al.,
2018; Fast &amp; Olson, 2018; Rae et al., 2019); and
3) the child will be emotionally and physically
safe during and following transition (Brown &amp;
Mar, 2018). Prejudice and discrimination should
be considerations, especially in localities where
acceptance of gender diversity is limited or prohibited (Brown &amp; Mar, 2018; Hendricks &amp; Testa,
2012; Turban, King et al., 2021). Of note, there
can also be possible risks to a gender diverse
child who does not socially transition, including
1) being ostracized or bullied for being perceived
as not conforming to prescribed community
gender roles and/or socially expected patterns of
behavior; and 2) living with the internal stress
or distress that the gender they know themselves
to be is incongruent with the gender they are
being asked to present to the world.</p>
<p>To promote gender health, the HCP should discuss the potential challenges of a social transition.
One concern often expressed relates to fear that a
child will preclude considering the possible evolution
of their gender identity as they mature or be reluctant to initiate another gender transition even if they
no longer feel their social transition matches their
current gender identity (Edwards-Leeper et al., 2016;
Ristori &amp; Steensma, 2016). Although limited, recent
research has found some parents/caregivers of children who have socially transitioned may discuss
with their children the option of new gender iterations (for example, reverting to an earlier expression of gender) and are comfortable about this
possibility (Olson et al., 2019). Another often identified social transition concern is that a child may
suffer negative sequelae if they revert to the former
gender identity that matches their sex designated at
birth (Chen et al., 2018; Edwards-Leeper et al., 2019;
Steensma &amp; Cohen-Kettenis, 2011). From this point
of view, parents/caregivers should be aware of the
potential developmental effect of a social transition
on a child.</p>
<p>HCPs should provide guidance to parents/caregivers and supports to a child when a social gender transition is being considered or taking place
by 1) providing consultation, assessment, and gender supports when needed and sought by the parents/caregivers; 2) aiding family members, as
needed, to understand the child’s desires for a
social transition and the family members’ own
feelings about the child’s expressed desires; 3)
exploring with, and learning from, the parents/
caregivers whether and how they believe a social
transition would benefit their child both now and
in their ongoing development; 4) providing guidance when parents/caregivers are not in agreement
about a social transition and offering the opportunity to work together toward a consistent understanding of their child’s gender status and needs;
5) providing guidance about safe and supportive
ways to disclose their child’s social transition to
others and to facilitate their child transitioning in
their various social environments (e.g., schools,
extended family); 6) facilitating communication,
when desired by the child, with peers about gender
and social transition as well as fortifying positive
peer relationships; 7) providing guidance when
social transition may not be socially accepted or
safe, either everywhere or in specific situations, or
when a child has reservations about initiating a
transition despite their wish to do so; there may
be multiple reasons for reservations, including
fears and anxieties; 8) working collaboratively with
family members and MHPs to facilitate a social
transition in a way that is optimal for the child’s
unfolding gender development, overall well-being,
and physical and emotional safety; and 9) providing psychoeducation about the many different trajectories the child’s gender may take over time,
leaving pathways open to future iterations of gender for the child, and emphasizing there is no
need to predict an individual child’s gender identity in the future (Malpas et al., 2018).</p>
<p>All of these tasks incorporate enhancing the
quality of communication between the child and
family members and providing an opportunity
for the child to be heard and listened to by all
family members involved. These relational processes in turn facilitate the parents/caregivers’
success in making informed decisions about the
advisability and/or parameters of a social transition for their child (Malpas et al., 2018).</p>
<p>One role of HCPs is to provide guidance and
support in situations in which children and parents/caregivers wish to proceed with a social transition but conclude that the social environment
would not be accepting of those choices, by 1)
helping parents/caregivers define and extend safe
spaces in which the child can express their authentic gender freely; 2) discussing with parents/caregivers ways to advocate that increase the likelihood
of the social environment being supportive in the
future, if this is a realistic goal; 3) intervening as
needed to help the child/family with any associated
distress and/or shame brought about by the continued suppression of authentic gender identity
and the need for secrecy; and 4) building both
the child’s and the family’s resilience, instilling the
understanding that if the social environment is
having difficulty accepting a child’s social transition and affirmed gender identity, it is not because
of some shortcoming in the child but because of
insufficient gender literacy in the social environment (Ehrensaft et al., 2018).</p>

<p>All children have the right to be supported
and respected in their gender identities (Human
Rights Campaign, 2018; Paré, 2020; SAMHSA,
2015). As noted above, gender diverse children
are a particularly vulnerable group (Barrow &amp;
Apostle, 2018; Cohen-Kettenis et al., 2003;
Giovanardi et al., 2018; Gower, Rider, Coleman
et al., 2018; Grossman &amp; D’Augelli, 2007;
Hendricks &amp; Testa, 2012; Reisner, Greytak et al.,
2015; Ristori &amp; Steensma, 2016; Roberts et al.,
2012; Tishelman &amp; Neumann-Mascis, 2018). The
responsibilities of HCPs as advocates encompass
acknowledging social determinants of health are
critical for marginalized minorities (Barrow &amp;
Mar, 2018; Hendricks &amp; Testa, 2012). Advocacy
is taken up by all HCPs in the form of child and
family support (APA, 2015; Malpas et al., 2018).
Some HCPs may be called on to move beyond
their individual offices or programs to advocate
for gender diverse children in the larger community, often in partnership with stakeholders,
including parents/caregivers, allies, and youth
(Kaufman &amp; Tishelman, 2018; Lopez et al., 2017;
Vanderburgh, 2009). These efforts may be instrumental in enhancing children’s gender health and
promoting their civil rights (Lopez et al., 2017).</p>
<p>HCP’s voices may be essential in schools, in
parliamentary bodies, in courts of law, and in
the media (Kuvalanka et al., 2019; Lopez et al.,
2017; Whyatt-Sames, 2017; Vanderburgh, 2009).
In addition, HCPs may have a more generalized
advocacy role in acknowledging and addressing
the frequent intentional or unintentional negating of the experience of gender diverse children
that may be transmitted or communicated by
adults, peers, and in media (Rafferty et al.,
2018). Professionals who possess the skill sets
and find themselves in appropriate situations
can provide clear de-pathologizing statements
on the needs and rights of gender diverse children and on the damage caused by discriminatory and transphobic rules, laws, and norms
(Rafferty et al., 2018).</p>

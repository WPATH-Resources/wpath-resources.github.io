<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 15</span> Primary Care<a href="primary-care.html#primary-care" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p>Primary care is the broadest of health care disciplines and is defined as the “provision of integrated, accessible health care services by health
care professionals who are accountable for
addressing a large majority of personal health
care needs, developing a sustained partnership
with patients, and practicing in the context of
family and community.” (Institute of
Medicine, 1996).</p>
<p>Primary care providers (PCPs) encompass a
wide range of health care professionals (HCPs)
who deliver this care, including general and family medical practitioners, nurse practitioners,
advanced practice nurses, physician associates/
assistants, and internists. PCPs are represented
by a variety of educational backgrounds, training,
and specialties. Given the type of degree and the
nature of the specialty, the scope of practice varies, and not all providers may be trained or qualified to directly provide the full breadth of
transgender health care, such as mental health,
genital/pelvic care, or postoperative care, following gender-affirming procedures. Physicians and
other providers receive little education in transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) health at any
time during their training (Dubin et al., 2018),
and thus most skills are currently acquired in
practice, either informally or through brief continuing education opportunities, see also Chapter
4—Education. However, if providers are competent to deliver similar care for cisgender patients,
they should develop competency in caring for
TGD patients. The competencies outlined below
are all to be understood as being within the provider’s scope of licensure and practice. However,
all PCPs should be able to manage the comprehensive health of TGD patients either directly or
by appropriate referral to other HCPs, including
other specialists, for evaluation and treatment.
There is no evidence competency in caring for
TGD patients can only be achieved through a
formal or certification process. In explicitly stating recommended competencies, however, PCP’s
and TGD persons across all settings can share a
standard set of expectations of the knowledge,
skills, and cultural competence required for the
care of TGD persons.</p>
<p>Due to the unique medical, surgical, and social
conditions faced by TGD people, PCPs need distinct competencies in the care of TGD persons,
apart from what is expected of all PCP’s who
may otherwise care for a diverse population that
includes ethnic, racial, or sexual minorities.
Professional bodies from a range of generalist
disciplines have issued position statements and
guidelines specific to the care of TGD people
(American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecology, 2021; Italian Society of Gender,
Identity and Health (SIGIS); the Italian Society
of Andrology and Sexual Medicine (SIAMS); the
Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE), 2021;
Polish Sexological Society, 2021; the Southern
African HIV Clinicians’ Society, 2021). Wylie
et al. (2016) state “For the most part, the general
health and well-being of transgender people
should be attended to within the primary care
setting, without differentiation from services
offered to cisgender (non-transgender) people for
physical, psychological, and sexual health issues.
Specific care for gender transition is also possible
in primary care.” There are many examples of
these services being provided safely and effectively outside of specialist care in diverse cities
such as Toronto and Vancouver in Canada, New
York and Boston in the US, and in Sydney,
Australia, (Radix &amp; Eisfeld, 2014; Reisner, Radix
et al., 2016; Spanos et al., 2021).</p>
<div id="hormone-therapy-1" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Hormone therapy<a href="primary-care.html#hormone-therapy-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Whether TGD patients receive medically necessary gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT)
from a specialist, e.g., an endocrinologist, or a
PCP may depend on the availability of knowledgeable and welcoming providers and
country-level factors, such as health care regulations and health services funding (see medically
necessary statement in Chapter 2—Global
Applicability, Statement 2.1). In much of the
world, specialty services for TGD people are
partly or wholly unavailable, which reinforces the
need for all health providers to undertake
training in the provision of gender-affirming care.
In some countries, PCPs may be required to refer
TGD patients to specialist services (e.g., gender
identity clinics) resulting in unacceptable delays
to access GAHT (Royal College of General
Practitioners, 2019).</p>
<p>Hormone-related therapy encompasses a range
of interventions, such as puberty suppression and
hormone initiation or hormone maintenance.
With training, gender-affirming hormone therapy
can be managed by most PCPs. Regardless of
whether they serve as the primary hormone prescriber, all PCPs should be familiar with the
medications, suggested monitoring, and potential
side effects associated with GAHT (see Chapter
12—Hormone Therapy). PCPs should be able to
make appropriate referrals to appropriate providers for all transition-related services they do not
themselves provide.</p>
<p>This chapter supports the argument GAHT can
be prescribed by PCPs or other
non-specialists—“Considering barriers to health
care access and the importance of GAHT to this
population, it is imperative that PCPs are able
and willing to provide GAHT for TGD patients.”
(Shires, 2017).</p>
<p>PCPs are commonly called upon to provide
care for a broad range of conditions and needs,
including those with which they may have had
limited or no prior experience. Often this involves
accessing commonly used and readily available
reference sources, such as professional society
guidelines or obtaining a subscription to online
knowledge bases. PCPs are advised to use a similar approach when asked to provide basic GAHT
care by using the Standards of Care as well as
other readily accessed resources (Cheung et al.,
2019; Hembree et al., 2017; Oliphant et al., 2018;
T’Sjoen et al., 2020). It should be noted most of
the commonly used medications in genderaffirming regimens are familiar to everyday primary care practice, including, but not limited to,
testosterone, estradiol, progesterone and other
progestagens, and spironolactone.</p>

<p>PCPs should be able and willing to assess and
provide mental health support for TGD
people and GAHT that can alleviate gender
dysphoria and allow gender expression. At the
very least, they should be aware of these
needs and consult additional specialty support
if needed.</p>

<p>General practitioners are versed to provide comprehensive primary and secondary cancer prevention as a part of routine primary care.
Evidence-based cancer prevention guidelines
vary globally due to differences in national
guidelines and levels of access to screening
modalities at the local level. To date, research
on the long-term impact of GAHT on cancer
risk is limited (Blondeel et al., 2016; Braun
et al., 2017). We have insufficient evidence to
estimate the prevalence of cancer of the breast
or reproductive organs among TGD populations
(Joint et al., 2018). However, cancer screening
should commence, in general, according to local
guidelines. Several modifications are discussed
in detail, below, depending on the type and
duration of hormone use, surgical intervention,
or both. In caring for transgender patients, the
PCP should maintain an updated record of
which organs are present in TGD patients so
that appropriate, routine screening can be
offered.</p>
<p>This organ inventory should be updated based
on the surgical history or any development that
has occurred due to taking gender-affirming hormones. Not all PCP’s provide care across the
lifespan. However, if providers routinely care for
children, adolescents, or elder cisgender persons,
they should develop competency in transgender
care that is applicable to these age groups. If they
are unable to do so, then PCPs should be able
to make appropriate referrals to other HCPs who
care for these populations.</p>
<p>All the statements in this chapter have been
recommended based on a thorough review of
evidence, an assessment of the benefits and
harms, values and preferences of providers and
patients, and resource use and feasibility. In
some cases, we recognize evidence is limited
and/or services may not be accessible or
desirable.</p>

<p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke are
the leading causes of mortality worldwide (World
Health Organization, 2018). Extensive data among
racial, ethnic, and sexual minorities in multiple
settings demonstrate significant disparities in the
prevalence of CVD and its risk factors as well as
in the outcomes to medical interventions.
Structural factors such as access to care, socioeconomic status, and allostatic load related to
minority stress contribute to these disparities
(Flentje et al., 2020; Havranek et al., 2015; Streed
et al., 2021). TGD people often experience social,
economic, and discriminatory conditions similar
to other minority populations with known
increased cardiovascular risk (Carpenter et al.,
2020; James et al., 2016; Reisner, Radix et al.,
2016). TGD persons of racial, ethnic, and sexual
minorities have been shown to experience
increased impact related to intersectional stress.
Conversely, access to gender-affirming care,
including GAHT, may buffer against the elevation
of CVD risk due to the improvement in quality
of life and reduction in gender dysphoria and
incongruence (Defreyne et al., 2019; Martinez
et al., 2018). PCPs can significantly improve TGD
health through screening and prevention of CVD
and its associated risk conditions—such as
tobacco use, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity.</p>
<p>The few, primarily US based, studies evaluating
the prevalence of CVD, stroke, or CVD risk in
TGD persons independent of GAHT indicate an
elevated CV risk, including high rates of undiagnosed and untreated CV risk factors with inadequate CV prevention when compared with
cisgender populations (Denby et al., 2021;
Malhotra et al., 2022; Nokoff et al., 2018). In one
population-based study, TGD people had greater
odds of discrimination, psychological distress, and
adverse childhood experience, and these were
associated with increased odds of having a cardiovascular condition (Poteat et al., 2021).</p>
<p>In US studies that are based on data from the
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, both
transgender men and transgender women show a
higher prevalence of myocardial infarction (MI),
stroke, or any CVD compared with cisgender men,
cisgender women or both. Results vary based on
the adjustment of data for additional variables,
including race, income, or cardiovascular risk factors (Alzahrani et al., 2019; Caceres et al., 2020;
Nokoff et al., 2018). Gender nonbinary persons
also have higher odds of CVD (Downing &amp;
Przedworski, 2018). Data on hormone use was not
collected in these studies, which are also limited
by the use of self-reported health histories. In the
US, TGD individuals presenting for GAHT may
have higher rates of undiagnosed and untreated
CVD risk factors compared with the cisgender
population (Denby et al., 2021), although this may
not be applicable globally.</p>
<p>A large 2018 case control study from several
US centers that used 10:1 cisgender matched controls found no statistically significant difference
in rates of MI or stroke between transgender
women and cisgender men, and no difference in
rates of MI, stroke, or venous thromboembolism
(VTE) between transgender men and cisgender
men or women. There was a statistically significant hazard ratio of 1.9 for VTE among transgender women when compared with cisgender
men. A subcohort of transgender women who
initiated GAHT during (versus prior to) the
6-year study window did show an increased risk
of stroke. Increases in rates of VTE in the overall
cohort of transgender women and in rates of
stroke in the initiation subcohort of transgender
women demonstrated calculated
numbers-needed-to-harm (not reported in the
paper) between 71-123 (Getahun et al., 2018).
Other studies have demonstrated no increase in
CV events or stroke among transgender men
undergoing testosterone therapy, although studies
are limited by their small sample size, relatively
short follow-up, and the younger age of the sample population (Martinez et al., 2020; Nota
et al., 2019).</p>
<p>European and US studies in transgender
women who have accessed feminizing GAHT
increasingly indicate a higher risk of CVD, stroke,
or both, compared with cisgender women and,
in some studies, cisgender men (Getahun et al.,
2018; Nota et al., 2019; Wierckx et al., 2013).
Many of these studies had significant limitations,
such as variably adjusting for CV-related risk
factors, small sample sizes—especially involving
older transgender women—and variable duration
and types of GAHT (Connelly et al., 2019;
Defreyne et al., 2019, Martinez et al., 2020).
Furthermore, the overall increased risk was small.
In many of these studies, the majority of transgender women who experienced cardiac events
or stroke were over 50 years old, had one or
more CVD risk factors, and were taking a variety
of hormone regimens, including, but not limited,
to ethinyl estradiol, a synthetic estrogen that confers significant elevations in thrombotic risk and
is not recommended for use in feminizing regimens (Gooren et al., 2014; Martinez et al., 2020).
Current limited evidence suggests estrogen-based
GAHT is associated with an increased risk of
myocardial infarction and stroke, but whether
this small risk is a result of GAHT or an effect
of pre-existing CV risk is unclear. There are no
known studies that specifically address CVD and
International Journal of Transgender Health S147
related conditions in nonbinary individuals, individuals who use subphysiologic doses of
gender-affirming hormones, or in adults previously treated with puberty suppression.</p>
<p>PCPs can best address CVD risk during GAHT
by assessing TGD people for CVD and modifiable
CVD risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and smoking, as
well as by addressing the impact of minority stress
on cardiovascular risk (Streed et al., 2021). In
addition, PCPs can mitigate transgender cardiovascular health disparities by providing a timely
diagnosis and treatment of risk conditions and by
tailoring their management in a way that supports
ongoing gender-affirming interventions.</p>
<p>Risk assessment guidelines vary based on the
national or international context and scientific
affiliation of guideline developers. CVD prevention guidelines also vary in terms of the nature
and frequency of the risk assessment for otherwise healthy adults under age 40 (Arnett et al.,
2019; Piepoli et al., 2020; Précoma et al., 2019;
Streed et al., 2021; WHO, 2007). Over age 40,
when cardiovascular risk increases, guidelines
clearly recommend scheduled risk assessments
using a calculated prediction of ten-year total
CVD risk based on risk prediction equations
from large population samples. Examples of risk
calculators include SCORE (recommended by the
European Guidelines on CVD Prevention), Pooled
Cohort Studies Equations (2013 AHA ACC
Guideline on the Assessment of CVD risk),
Framingham Risk scores, and the World Health
Organization (WHO) Risk Prediction Charts. The
WHO charts were developed based on information from the countries in each WHO subregion.
In many low resource settings, facilities are not
available to measure cholesterol or serum glucose,
and alternative predication charts are available
without these measures.</p>
<p>Of note, all current cardiovascular risk calculators are gendered, using sex as a significant risk
variable. There is currently insufficient data on
cardiovascular risk interventions across the lifespan in TGD persons with medical and surgical
interventions to adjust these predictive equations.
Nonetheless, it is clear both sex assigned at birth
and medical transition can affect the parameters
used to calculate cardiovascular risk (Connelly
et al., 2019; Defreyne et al., 2019; Maraka et al.,
2017; Martinez et al., 2020). Providers can take
a variety of approaches to using cardiovascular
risk calculators in TGD persons, including
employing the risk calculator for the sex assigned
at birth, affirmed gender, or a weighted average
of the two, taking into consideration total lifetime
exposure to GAHT. Although data are lacking,
using the affirmed gender for transgender adults
with a history of pubertal-age GAHT initiations
is likely to be most appropriate. Patients with a
history of submaximal GAHT use or prolonged
periods of time postgonadectomy without hormone replacement before roughly age 50 may
require an even more nuanced approach. Providers
should be aware of the characteristics and limitations of the risk calculator in use and should
engage patients in shared decision-making regarding these specific considerations.</p>
<p>There are currently no studies comparing the
prevalence of dyslipidemia between transgender
and cisgender samples, while controlling for hormone use. As noted previously, data in other
populations demonstrate the presence of psychosocial stress during childhood and remote adulthood favor adiposity and abnormal lipid
metabolism. Both testosterone- and estrogen-based
GAHT affect lipid metabolism, although evidence
is limited by the variety of hormone regimens
and additional variables (Connelly et al., 2019;
Defreyne et al., 2019; Deutsch, Glidden et al.,
2015; Maraka et al., 2017; Martinez et al., 2020;).
On balance, estrogen tends to increase
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and
triglycerides with variable effects on low density
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, while testosterone
variably affects triglycerides, decreases HDL cholesterol and increases LDL cholesterol. The
method of administration may also affect this
pattern, particularly in relation to oral versus
transdermal estrogen and their impact on triglycerides (Maraka et al., 2017). In general, the
effect sizes of these differences are minimal, and
the overall impact on cardio- and cerebrovascular
outcomes is unclear. There are no studies examining hormone effects in TGD people with
pre-existing dyslipidemia with hormone use starting over age 50, or investigating effects beyond
2-5 years of therapy.</p>
<p>Studies comparing the prevalence of hypertension between TGD and cisgender samples that
controlled for hormone use are lacking. Data in
other populations demonstrate chronic and acute
psychosocial stress, including experiences of discrimination can mediate hypertension
(Din-Dzietham et al., 2004; Spruill, 2010). In US
studies that were based on the Behavioral Risk
Factor Surveillance System, a large national US
health survey, there were no differences in
reported hypertension between transgender men
or women compared with cisgender samples
(Alzahrani et al., 2019; Nokoff et al., 2018).</p>
<p>Studies of testosterone—and estrogen-based
GAHT have shown inconsistent effects on systolic
and diastolic blood pressure. A retrospective
study of the effects of estrogen- and testosteronebased GAHT regimens on blood pressure found
a slight reduction in systolic blood pressure with
the initiation of estrogen-based regimens; while
there was a slight elevation (4 mm Hg) in mean
systolic blood pressure on long term follow-up
of testosterone-based regimens, this difference
was at the margin of statistical significance and
of limited clinical relevance (Banks et al., 2021).
A systematic review concluded, given the limited
quality of the studies, there is insufficient data
to reach conclusions on the effects of
gender-affirming hormone therapy on blood pressure (Connelly et al., 2021). Spironolactone, often
used as an androgen blocker in feminizing GAHT,
is a potassium sparing diuretic and may increase
potassium when used in conjunction with ACE
inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker medications, as well as salt substitutes. There are no
studies examining hormone effects in TGD people with pre-existing hypertension with hormone
use starting over age 50, or investigating effects
beyond 2–5 years of therapy. Transgender persons
receiving GAHT should undergo any additional
blood pressure screening or monitoring indicated
by WPATH guidelines for GAHT.</p>
<p>There are limited data comparing the prevalence
of diabetes mellitus between TGD and cisgender
samples independent of hormone use. Recent data
from the STRONG cohort study (Islam et al.,
2021) found the prevalence and incidence of type
2 diabetes was more common in the trans feminine cohort compared with cisgender females but
not cisgender male controls. No significant differences in the prevalence or incidence of type 2
diabetes were observed in the trans masculine
cohort and in TGD persons overall after starting
hormone therapy. However, the mean follow-up
for both cohorts was 2.8 and 3.1 years, respectively
(Islam et al., 2021). Data in other populations,
including sexual minorities, indicates chronic and
acute psychosocial stress can mediate the development and control of type 2 diabetes (Beach
et al., 2018; Kelly &amp; Mubarak, 2015).</p>
<p>US studies based on the Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System found no differences in
reported diabetes between transgender men,
transgender women and nonbinary persons compared with cisgender persons (Alzahrani et al.,
2019; Caceres et al., 2020; Nokoff et al., 2018).
Several small studies have shown a higher-than-expected prevalence of polycystic ovarian syndrome
or hyperandrogenemia among transgender men
(Feldman et al., 2016), conditions associated with
insulin resistance and diabetes risk. While studies
of both testosterone- and estrogen-based GAHT
show varying effects on weight/body fat, glucose
metabolism, and insulin resistance (Defreyne
et al., 2019), most do not demonstrate any
increase in prediabetes or diabetes (Chan et al.,
2018; Connelly et al., 2019). There are no studies
examining hormone effects in TGD people with
pre-existing diabetes, with hormone use starting
over age 50, or investigating effects beyond 2–5
years of therapy. There are currently no studies
specifically addressing diabetes in adults previously treated with puberty suppression.</p>
<p>While intermediate-outcome studies of the
effects of GAHT on blood pressure and lipids
are helpful for hypothesis generation and for
studying etiology, future studies should focus on
cardiovascular outcomes of interest, with a specific focus on individual predictors such as age,
route and dose of hormones used, and total lifetime exposure to GAHT. Interpretation of data
should always consider whether cisgender controls were of the same natal sex or identified gender.</p>

<h2>Statement 15.4: We recommend health care professionals counsel transgender and gender diverse people about their tobacco use and advise tobacco/nicotine abstinence prior to gender-affirming surgery.<a href="primary-care.html#statement-15.4-we-recommend-health-care-professionals-counsel-transgender-and-gender-diverse-people-about-their-tobacco-use-and-advise-tobacconicotine-abstinence-prior-to-gender-affirming-surgery." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Tobacco use is a leading contributor to cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, and cancer worldwide (World Health Organization, 2020).
TGD persons have a higher prevalence of tobacco
use compared with cisgender individuals, which
varies across the gender spectrum (Azagba et al.,
2019; Buchting et al., 2017). This pattern is consistent with other populations experiencing
minority stress (Gordon et al., 2021). PCPs can
promote protective factors against tobacco use,
including reducing exposure to personal or structural discrimination, having gender-affirming
identification, and having health insurance (Kidd
et al., 2018; Shires &amp; Jafee, 2016).</p>
<p>The health risks of tobacco use affect TGD
persons disproportionately, primarily due to
decreased access to culturally competent, affordable screening, and treatment of tobacco-related
diseases (Shires &amp; Jafee, 2016). Smoking may
further increase cardiovascular and VTE risk for
TGD individuals taking feminizing GAHT
(Hontscharuk, Alba, Manno et al., 2021). Smoking
also doubles or triples the risk of general surgery
complications, such as wound healing, scarring,
and infection (Yoong et al., 2020) and increases
these risks for those accessing gender-affirming
surgeries. Data in cisgender populations show
quitting smoking prior to surgery and maintaining abstinence for six weeks postoperatively significantly reduces complications (Yoong
et al., 2020).</p>
<p>There are currently few studies of smoking
cessation programs specifically focused on TGD
persons (Berger &amp; Mooney-Somers, 2017).
However, limited evidence suggests PCPs can
enhance smoking cessation efforts by addressing
the effects of minority stress (Gamarel et al.,
2015) and incorporating gender-affirming interventions, such as GAHT (Myers &amp; Safer, 2016).</p>
<p>HCPs should take into consideration the significant barriers people habituated to nicotine
encounter when attempting cessation. Nicotine
replacement therapy and/or other cessation
adjuncts should be made available, with an emphasis on individual preferences and a recognition of
underlying behavioral health factors that contribute
to continued nicotine use. Decision-making
regarding approaches to GAHT or surgery should
include consideration of the “first do no harm”
principle of medical practice, with the realities of
an individual patient’s abilities and needs.</p>

<p>Aging presents specific social, physical, and
mental health challenges for TGD persons. While
the literature on aging and transgender elders is
limited, many older TGD adults have experienced
a lifetime of stigma, discrimination, and repression of identified gender (Fabbre &amp; Gaveras,
2020; Witten, 2017). This experience affects TGD
elders’ interactions with health care systems
(Fredriksen-Goldsen et al., 2014; Kattari &amp;
Hasche, 2016; Walker et al., 2017). Transgender
elders are more likely than cisgender LGB peers
to report poor physical health, even when controlling for socio-demographic factors
(Fredriksen-Goldsen 2011; Fredriksen-Goldsen
et al., 2014). Reduced access to culturally competent care and the sequelae of minority stress
often result in delayed care, potentially exacerbating chronic conditions common with aging
(Bakko &amp; Kattari, 2021; Fredriksen-Goldsen
et al., 2014).</p>
<p>Although there are few studies on
gender-affirming medical interventions among
TGD elders, evidence suggests older adults experience a significantly higher quality of life with
medical transition even when compared with
younger TGD adults (Cai et al., 2019). Although
age itself is not an absolute contraindication or
limitation to gender-affirming medical or surgical
interventions, TGD elders may not be aware of
the current range of social, medical or surgical
options available that can help them meet their
individual needs (Hardacker et al., 2019;
Houlberg, 2019).</p>
<p>While studies on mental health among TGD
elders are limited, those over age fifty experience
significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms
and perceived stress compared with cisgender
LGB and heterosexual older adults
(Fredriksen-Goldsen 2011, Fredriksen-
Goldsen et al., 2014). Risk factors specific to
TGD elders include gender- and age-related discrimination, general stress, identity concealment,
victimization, and internalized stigma, while
social support and community belonging appear
protective (Fredriksen-Goldsen et al., 2014;
Hoy-Ellis &amp; Fredriksen-Goldsen, 2017; White
Hughto &amp; Reisner, 2018). PCPs can assist patients
by encouraging spirituality, self-acceptance and
self-advocacy, and an active healthy lifestyle, all
of which are associated with resilience and successful aging (McFadden et al., 2013; Witten, 2014).</p>
<p>TGD elders often face social isolation, loss of
support systems, and disconnection from close
friends and children (Fredriksen-Goldsen 2011;
Witten, 2017). The most common aging concerns
among TGD persons are losing the ability to care
for themselves followed by having to go into a
nursing home or assisted living facility (Henry
et al., 2020). While long-term care settings offer
the helpful needed assistance, they also have the
potential for physical or emotional abuse, for denial
of GAHT and routine care, for being “outed,” and
being prevented from living and dressing according
to one’s affirmed gender (Auldridge et al., 2012;
Pang et al., 2019; Porter et al., 2016). TGD elders
identify senior housing, transportation, social
events, support groups as being the most needed
services (Auldridge et al., 2012; Witten, 2014).</p>
<p>Despite barriers, most TGD persons engage in
successful aging strengthened by self-acceptance, caring relationships, and advocacy (Fredriksen-Goldsen
2011; Witten, 2014). PCPs should address core health
issues facing TGD elders, including mental health,
gender-affirming medical interventions, social support, and end of life/long-term care.</p>
<p>Beyond the independent impact of factors such
as minority stress and social determinants of
health in later years, data are lacking on specific
health issues facing transgender people who use
GAHT later in life, individuals who began GAHT
at a younger age, and those seeking to continue
or begin GAHT in their sixth, seventh, eighth,
or later decades. With an increasing proportion
of transgender people beginning GAHT at
younger ages, including some who begin at the
time of puberty, studies to examine the impact
of decades of such treatment on long-term health
are ever more important.</p>

<p>TGD individuals taking estrogen-based GAHT
will develop breasts, and therefore warrant consideration for breast cancer screening. Exogenous
estrogen may be one of multiple factors that contribute to breast cancer risk in cisgender people.
Two cohort studies have been published evaluating breast cancer prevalence among transgender
women in the Netherlands (Gooren et al., 2013)
and the US (Brown &amp; Jones, 2015). Both were
retrospective cohorts of clinical samples using a
diagnosis of breast cancer as the outcome of
interest and cisgender controls as a comparison
group. Neither study involved prospective screening for breast cancer, and both had significant
methodological limitations. Numerous guidelines
have been published (Deutsch, 2016a) recommending some combination of “age plus length
of estrogen exposure” as the determinant of need
to commence screening. These recommendations
are based on expert consensus only and are evidentiarily weak.</p>
<p>BRCA1 and 2 mutations increase the risk of
breast cancer, however the role sex hormone
exposure plays, if any, in this increased risk is
unclear (Rebbeck et al., 2005) The degree of
increase in risk, if any, from gender-affirming
estrogen therapy is unknown. Patients with a
known BRCA1 mutation should be counseled
about the unknowns and shared decision-making
with informed consent should occur between the
patient and provider, recognizing the numerous
benefits of GAHT.</p>
<p>Breast cancer screening among transgender
women should also take into consideration the
likelihood that a transgender woman’s breasts may
be denser on mammography. Dense breasts, a
history of injecting breasts with fillers such as
silicone, and breast implants may complicate the
interpretation of mammographic findings
(Sonnenblick et al., 2018). Therefore, special
International Journal of Transgender Health S151
techniques should be used accordingly. People
who have injected particles such as silicone or
other fillers for breast augmentation may also
develop complications, such as sclerosing lipogranulomas, which obscure normal tissue on mammography or ultrasound.</p>

<p>For TGD people assigned female at birth and
who developed breasts via natal puberty, there are
theoretical concerns about whether direct exposure
to testosterone and exposure to aromatized estrogen resulting from testosterone therapy are risk
factors for the development of breast cancer.
Limited retrospective data has not demonstrated
increased risk for breast cancer among transgender
men (Gooren et al., 2013; Grynberg et al., 2010),
however prospective and comparison data are
lacking. Most people in this group will have some
breast tissue remaining, and therefore it is important for providers to be aware breast cancer risk
is not zero in this population. The timing and
approach to breast cancer screening in this group
who have had chest surgery is currently not established, and, similar to cisgender men with significant family history or BRCA gene mutation,
screening via MRI or ultrasound may be appropriate. Because the utility and performance of
these approaches have not been studied and
because self- and HCP-led chest/breast screening
exams are not recommended in cisgender women
due to potential harms of both false-positive
results and over-detection (detection of a cancer
which would have regressed on its own with no
need for intervention), any approach to screening
in this group should occur in the context of
shared decision-making between patients and providers regarding the potential harms, benefits, and
unknowns of these approaches.</p>

transgender men have been reported (Dizon et al.,

risk of ovarian cancer, although long-term prospective studies are lacking (Joint et al., 2018).</p>

<p>TGD people with ovaries who are taking
testosterone-based GAHT are often in an oligo- or
anovulatory state, or otherwise experience shifts
in luteal phase function and progesterone production. This condition combined with the possible
increased estrogen exposure from aromatization
of exogenous testosterone raises the concern for
excessive or unopposed endometrial estrogen
exposure, although the clinical significance is
unknown. Histologic studies of the endometrium
in TGD people taking testosterone have found
atrophy rather than hyperplasia (Grimstad et al.,
2018; Grynberg et al., 2010; Perrone et al., 2009).
In a large cohort of trans masculine people who
underwent a hysterectomy with oophorectomy,
benign ovarian histopathology was noted in all
cases (n = 85) (Grimstad et al., 2020). While prospective outcome data are lacking, there is insufficient evidence at this time to support a
recommendation transgender men undergo routine
hysterectomy or oophorectomy solely to prevent
endometrial or ovarian cancer. Certainly, unexplained signs/symptoms of endometrial or ovarian
cancer should be evaluated appropriately.</p>

<p>Individuals with a cervix should undergo routine cervical cancer screening and prevention
according to age-based regional practices and
guidelines. This includes vaccination against the
human papilloma virus (HPV) and screening
according to local guidelines, including cytologic,
high-HPV co-testing if available. It is important
HCPs be mindful of performing pelvic speculum
examinations in a manner that minimizes pain
and distress for transgender masculine people.</p>
<p>TGD people with a cervix are less likely to
have had conventional cervical cancer screening,
either because the exam can cause worsening of
dysphoria and/or because general practitioners
and patients are misinformed about the need for
this screening (Agenor et al., 2016; Potter et al.,
2015). In addition, testosterone therapy can result
in atrophic changes of the genital tract, and the
duration of testosterone use has been associated
with a greater likelihood of obtaining an inadequate sample for cytologic screening of cervical
cancer (Peitzmeier et al., 2014). Alternatives to
speculum exams and cervical cytology, such as
provider- or self-collected high-risk HPV swabs,
may be of particular benefit for screening people
with a cervix. Research underway in the US is
investigating the use of self-collected vaginal
high-risk HPV testing among transgender masculine populations. HPV swabs were found to be
highly acceptable among transgender men with
a sensitivity to high-risk HPV of 71.4% (negative
predictive value of 94.7%) and a specificity of
98.2% (Reisner et al., 2018). Further study is
needed to evaluate the harms of HPV primary
screening in transgender men in terms of the
potential increased harms associated with invasive
examinations and colposcopies.</p>

<p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence is disproportionately high in TGD
populations. A recent large metanalysis found a
global odds ratio for HIV infection of sixty-six
for trans feminine individuals and 6.8 for trans
masculine individuals (Stutterheim et al., 2021).
PCPs have unique opportunities to provide crucial education and implement prevention strategies, especially related to decreasing HIV
burden among TGD people. Mistrust of health
care providers due to past experiences of discrimination and transphobia impacts HIV prevention and disrupts the linkage to care efforts
(Sevelius et al., 2016). Stigma, lack of adequate
training, and innate power hierarchies within
medical establishments, all contribute to ambivalence and uncertainty among HCPs when caring for TGD people (Poteat et al., 2013). Finally,
a lack of inclusiveness and gender-affirming
practices in the health care setting may lead to
TGD people feeling unsafe discussing sensitive
topics, such as HIV diagnosis and avoiding care
out of fear (Bauer et al., 2014; Gibson et al.,
2016; Seelman et al., 2017).</p>
<p>HCPs should be aware of this broader context
within which many TGD people are seeking care
for either gender-affirming hormones, HIV
pre-exposure chemoprophylaxis/treatment (PrEP),
or both. There may be various misconceptions
about the safety of taking gender-affirming hormones concurrently with antiretroviral therapy
for HIV chemoprophylaxis or treatment.</p>
<p>Direct study of antiretroviral/gender-affirming
hormone therapy (ART/GAHT) interactions has
been limited. A subanalysis of transgender women
and trans feminine persons in the multinational
iPrEx trial found poor effectiveness in this group
in the intention-to-treat analysis, although effectiveness was similar to that in cisgender gay men
among those transgender participants who
adhered to the medication as prescribed, suggesting that uptake and adherence to PrEP remain
challenging in this population. Two studies of
the effects of GAHT on tenofovir diphosphate
(Grant et al., 2021) and tenofovir diphosphate
and emtricitabine (Shieh et al., 2019) found the
significantly lowered ART drug levels were
unlikely to be of clinical significance. Overall,
data on the interactions between hormonal contraceptives and antiretrovirals are reassuring in
terms of the impact of hormones on ART (Nanda
International Journal of Transgender Health S153
et al., 2017). Because estradiol is partially metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and 1A2
enzymes, potential drug interactions with other
medications that induce or inhibit these pathways, such as non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors (NNRTIs, e.g., efavirenz (EFV) and
nevirapine (NVP)), may exist (Badowski et al.,
2021). However, the preferred first-line ART regimens in most countries include integrase inhibitors, which have minimal to no drug interactions
with gender-affirming hormones and can be used
safely (Badowski, 2021; Department of Health
and Human Services. Panel on Antiretroviral
Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents, 2021). If
concerns exist about potential interactions, HCPs
should monitor blood hormone levels as needed.
Therefore, TGD people living with HIV and taking antiretroviral medications should be counseled that taking antiretrovirals alongside GAHT
is safe.</p>

<p>Estrogen and testosterone both support bone
formation and turnover. Decreased sex hormone
levels are associated with a greater risk of osteoporosis in older age (Almeida et al., 2017). TGD
individuals may receive medical and/or surgical
interventions that have the potential to influence
bone health, such as sex hormone treatment,
androgen blockade, and gonadectomy. Therefore,
a detailed medical history, including past and
present use of hormones along with gonadal surgeries, is necessary to establish the need for osteoporosis screening.</p>
<p>Several observational studies have compared
bone mineral density (BMD) of TGD adults
before and after gender-affirming hormone therapy along with in TGD individuals compared
with sex-at-birth matched cisgender controls.</p>
<p>Low BMD may exist before the initiation of
hormones. One study showed a lower mean areal
BMD at the femoral neck, total hip, and spine
in transgender women than in age-matched cisgender male controls (Van Caenegem, Taes et al.,
2013). Another study revealed a high prevalence
of low BMD scores among TGD youth before
starting puberty blockers (Lee, Finlayson et al.,
2020). The authors of both studies concluded low
rates of physical activity may be an important
contributor to these findings.</p>
<p>Acceleration of bone loss can occur after gonadectomy if hormones are stopped or if hormones
levels are suboptimal. In one study, thirty percent
of transgender women who had undergone gonadectomy had low bone mass, and this correlated
with lower 17-ß estradiol levels and adherence
to GAHT (Motta et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Investigation of the effects of GAHT on BMD
have revealed TGD women receiving estrogen
therapy show improvements in BMD. A systematic review and meta-analysis on the impact of
sex hormones on bone health of transgender
individuals included 9 eligible studies in transgender women (n = 392) and 8 eligible studies in
transgender men (n = 247) published between
2008 and 2015. The meta-analysis revealed transgender women showed a statistically significant
increase in lumbar spine BMD (but not femoral
neck BMD) compared with baseline measures.
Among transgender men, there were no statistically significant changes in the lumbar spine,
femoral neck, and total hip BMD at 12 and 24
months after starting testosterone compared with
baseline measures (Singh-Ospina et al., 2017).
Since the publication of this study, the European
Network for Investigation of Gender Incongruence
(ENIGI) study, a multicenter prospective observational study (Belgium, Norway, Italy, and the
Netherlands) published results on BMD outcomes
for 231 transgender women and 199 transgender
men one year after initiating GAH (Wiepjes
et al., 2017). Transgender women had an increase
in BMD of the lumbar spine, total hip and
femoral neck, and increased BMD of the total
hip occurred in transgender men. One study
reported no fractures in transgender individuals
at 12 months following initiation of hormones in
53 transgender men and 53 transgender women
(Wierckx, van Caenegem et al., 2014). No studies
suggest GAHT should be an indication for
enhanced osteoporosis screening. Rather, gaps in
GAHT in those who have undergone prior gonadectomy would be a consideration for such
screening.</p>
<p>Clinical practice guidelines include recommendations for osteoporosis screening in TGD individuals (Deutsch, 2016a; Hembree et al., 2017;
Rosen et al., 2019). For TGD people, both the
International Society for Clinical Densitometry
and the Endocrine Society suggest consideration
of baseline BMD screening before initiation of
hormones. Further recommendations for BMD
screening are based on several factors including
sex reported at birth and age along with the presence of traditional risk factors for osteoporosis,
such as prior fracture, high risk medication use,
conditions associated with bone loss, and low
body weight (Rosen et al., 2019). Specifically, the
ISCD guidelines state BMD testing is indicated
for TGD individuals if they have a history of
gonadectomy or therapy that lowers endogenous
gonadal steroid levels prior to the initiation of
GAHT, hypogonadism with no plan to take
GAHT or known indications for BMD testing
(Rosen et al., 2019). However, the evidentiary
basis for these recommendations is weak.</p>
<p>The recommended screening modality for osteoporosis is dual energy x-ray absorptiometry
(DXA) of the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral
neck (Kanis, 1994). However in many low- and
middle-income countries, BMD tests using DXA
are not available, and routine DXA-based screening is conducted in few countries, the US being
an exception.</p>
<p>PCPs should discuss ways to optimize bone
health with TGD people. In addition, PCPs
should provide information about the importance
of nutrition and exercise on maintaining bone
health. TGD individuals with (or at risk) for osteoporosis should be informed about the benefits
of weight bearing exercise along with strength
and resistance exercises in limiting bone loss
(Benedetti et al., 2018). Nutrition is integral to
bone health. Nutritional deficiencies, including
insufficient calcium intake and low vitamin D,
can result in low bone mineralization. Vitamin
D and calcium supplementation have been shown
to reduce hip as well as total fracture incidence
(Weaver et al., 2016). Although relevant to all
populations, this discussion is pertinent as a high
prevalence of hypovitaminosis D has been
observed in TGD populations (Motta et al., 2020;
Van Caenegem, Taes et al., 2013).</p>

<h2>Statement 15.14: We recommend health care professionals offer transgender and gender diverse people referrals for hair removal from the face, body, and genital areas for gender-affirmation or as part of a preoperative preparation process.<a href="primary-care.html#statement-15.14-we-recommend-health-care-professionals-offer-transgender-and-gender-diverse-people-referrals-for-hair-removal-from-the-face-body-and-genital-areas-for-gender-affirmation-or-as-part-of-a-preoperative-preparation-process." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Hair removal is necessary both for the elimination of facial hair (Marks et al., 2019) as well
as in preparation for certain gender-affirming
surgeries (GAS) such as vaginoplasty, phalloplasty,
and metoidioplasty (Zhang et al., 2016).
Preoperative permanent hair removal is required
for any skin area that will either be brought into
contact with urine (e.g., used to construct a neourethra) or be moved to reside within a partially
closed cavity within the body (e.g., used to line
the neovagina) (Zhang et al., 2016). Hair removal
techniques used in gender-affirming care are electrolysis hair removal (EHR) and laser hair
removal (LHR) (Fernandez et al., 2013). EHR is
currently the only US Food and Drug
Administration–approved method of permanent
hair removal, whereas LHR is approved for permanent hair reduction (Thoreson et al., 2020).</p>
<p>EHR involves the use of an electric current
with a very fine probe that is manually inserted
sequentially into individual hair follicles (Martin
et al., 2018). Since this method uses direct
mechanical destruction of the blood supply to
the hair, it can be used on all hair colors and
skin types (Martin et al., 2018). EHR is time
consuming and costly as it requires each hair
follicle to be treated individually, but is effective
for permanent hair removal. For genital permanent hair removal prior to GAS, this treatment
needs to be performed by a practitioner competent in genital hair removal as this method differs
International Journal of Transgender Health S155
from that of the face and body. EHR is more
painful than LHR, with possible side effects of
erythema, crusting, and swelling (Harris et al.,
2014). Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation is a
risk for dark-skinned individuals (Richards &amp;
Meharg, 1995). Pain can be controlled with topical local anesthetic and cooling techniques, and
tolerance to EHR does develop to some degree
with many persons able to tolerate longer sessions
(Richards &amp; Meharg, 1995).</p>
<p>LHR uses laser energy to target hair follicles. It
is beneficial for larger surface areas. The mechanism is photo-thermolysis, whereby light from a
laser selectively targets melanin in the hair shaft
(Gao et al., 2018). This energy is converted to
heat, which damages the follicles within the skin
that produce hairs and results in the destruction
of hair growth. Further treatments are needed to
achieve best results and are typically spaced six
weeks apart to allow for hair cycling (Zhang et al.,
2016). Because LHR targets melanin, results may
be limited for those with grey, blonde, or red hair.</p>
<p>There are specific considerations for using
LHR in dark-skinned individuals (Fitzpatrick skin
types IV to VI) (Fayne et al., 2018)). The higher
melanin content of the epidermis can compete
with the target chromophore of the light or laser,
which is the melanin in the hair shaft of the hair
follicle. For selective thermolysis to occur, heat
diffuses from the hair shaft to the follicular stem
cells to cause damage. In darker skin types, rather
than reaching the target melanin in the hair shaft,
light is absorbed in the epidermis where it is
then converted to heat. This may result in poorer
clinical outcomes and a higher rate of thermally
induced adverse effects, such as hypo- or hyperpigmentation, blistering, and crust formation
(Fayne et al., 2018). The selection of laser wavelength is critical in reducing this risk, with longer
wavelength recommended to minimize the
absorption of light in epidermal melanin and thus
maximize efficacy and minimize adverse effects
in patients with dark skin (Zhang et al., 2016).
Side effects from LHR can include the feeling of
sunburnt after treatment, as well as inflammation,
redness, hyperpigmentation, and swelling. Flashing
lights have been known to induce seizures in
susceptible patients, so patients should be
screened for this risk. Pain and discomfort during
the procedure can also represent a significant
barrier, and PCPs should be prepared to prescribe
topical or systemic analgesics, such as a eutectic
mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA) or a low
dose systemic opioid. For genital GAS, some have
recommended a 3-month wait after the last
planned hair removal treatment before proceeding
with surgery to confirm that no further hair
regrowth will occur (Zhang et al., 2016).</p>

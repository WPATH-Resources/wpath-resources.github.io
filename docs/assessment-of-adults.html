<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 5</span> Assessment of Adults<a href="assessment-of-adults.html#assessment-of-adults" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p>This chapter provides guidance for the assessment
of transgender and gender diverse (TGD) adults
who are requesting medically necessary
gender-affirming medical and/or surgical treatments
(GAMSTs) to better align their body with their
gender identity (see medically necessary statement
in Chapter 2—Global Applicability, Statement 2.1).</p>
<p>TGD adults are people at or above the age of
majority in their country, who have some form
of gender diversity. The developmental elements
of the adolescent chapter, including the importance of parental/caregiver involvement, may be
relevant for the care of young adults too, even if
they are above the age of majority.</p>
<p>This chapter includes all forms of gender identities and transitions including, but not limited
to, male, female, gender diverse, nonbinary, agender, and eunuch. The population of TGD adults
is heterogeneous and will vary according to their
clinical need, biological, psychological, and social
situations, as well as their access to health care.
As such, any assessment for GAMSTs will need
to be adapted to the scientific, clinical, and community knowledge base of the presenting gender
identity as well as local circumstances. This chapter recognizes individuals may experience different local levels of clinical or regulatory oversight
when the state or others are providing health care.</p>
<p>An individual’s gender identity is an internal
identification and experience. The role of the
assessor is to assess for the presence of gender
incongruence and identify any co-existing mental
health concerns, to offer information about
GAMSTs, to support the TGD person in considering the effects/risks of GAMSTs, and to assess
if the TGD person has the capacity to understand
the treatment being offered and if the treatment
is likely to be of benefit. The assessor can also
assist a TGD person to consider choices that
could improve their GAMST outcomes. The
GAMST assessment approach described in this
chapter recognizes the lived experience and
self-knowledge of the TGD person and the clinical knowledge of the assessing health care professional (HCP). Consequently, with this approach,
the decision to move forward with GAMSTs is
shared between the TGD person and the
assessing HCP, with both playing a key part in
collaborative decision-making.</p>
<p>Some systems use a model of care for TGD
adults seeking GAMSTs that prioritizes the TGD
adult as the decision maker with the HCP acting
as an advisor, barring serious contraindications.
These models are used when considering hormone therapy rather than surgery and are often
called “informed consent” models (Deutsch, 2011,
2016a). Many such models utilize an abbreviated
assessment that focuses primarily on the ability
of a TGD person to grant informed consent and
to utilize information about GAMSTs to inform
their medical decision-making. There is significant variability in such models across jurisdictions, systems, and HCPs (Deutsch, 2011; Morenz
et al., 2020). Informed consent models have been
used for some time for hormone prescription in
many local settings.</p>
<p>This chapter is intended to offer flexible global
guidance that must be adapted to local circumstances. HCPs will need to determine which
assessment approaches best meet the needs in
their local settings. The evaluation of these
approaches is best undertaken in collaboration
with TGD people.</p>
<p>Since TGD people represent a diverse array of
gender identities and expressions and have differing needs for GAMSTs, no single assessment
process will fit every person or every situation.
Some TGD people may need a comparatively
brief assessment process for GAMSTs. For TGD
adults with a complex presentation or for those
who are requesting less common treatments or
treatments with limited research evidence, more
comprehensive assessments with different members of a multidisciplinary team will be required.
Assessments may be in person or through telehealth. While psychometric assessment tools have
been used in some instances, they are not a
required part of the assessment for GAMSTs.
Counseling or psychotherapy can be helpful when
requested by a TGD person. However, counseling
or psychotherapy specifically focused on their
TGD identity is not a requirement for the assessment or initiation of GAMSTs. Genital exams are
not a prerequisite for initiation of GAMTs and
should be performed only when clinically
indicated.</p>
<p>GAMSTs can be delivered in diverse settings.
Settings will depend on available health care systems within each country and may include nationalized/public health care, private sector settings,
community health care settings, and charitable
institutions. Local and regional circumstances may
therefore influence the availability of health care.
Regardless of the setting, health care offered to
TGD people should be of the highest possible
quality. World Professional Organization for
Transgender Health (WPATH) advocates for
assessment and treatment to be readily available.
Access to assessment and treatment for TGD
people seeking GAMSTs is critical given the clear
medical necessity of these interventions and the
profound benefits they offer to TGD people
(Aldridge et al., 2020; Byne et al., 2012). The guidance in this chapter will need to be adapted
according to local, as well as individual, clinical,
and social circumstances.</p>
<p>The statements below are based on significant
background literature, including literature demonstrating the strong positive impact of access to
GAMSTs; available empirical evidence; a favorable
risk-benefit ratio; and consensus of professional
best practice. The empirical evidence base for the
assessment of TGD adults is limited. It primarily
includes an assessment approach that uses specific criteria that are examined by an HCP in
close cooperation with a TGD adult and does
not include randomized controlled trials or
long-term longitudinal research (Olsen-Kennedy
et al., 2016). This is understandable given the
complexity and ethical considerations of allocating patients in need of care to different assessment groups and the lack of funding for research
and other resources to assess long-term outcomes
of assessment approaches.</p>
<p>The creation of this guidance has been a complex
undertaking. The criteria in this chapter have been
significantly revised from SOC-7 to reduce requirements and unnecessary barriers to care. It is hoped
that future research will explore the effectiveness
of this model as well as evolving assessment models
for hormone therapy and for surgery that will allow
continued improvements to be made.</p>
<p>All the statements in this chapter have been
recommended based on a thorough review of
evidence, an assessment of the benefits and
harms, values and preferences of providers and
patients, and resource use and feasibility. In some
cases, we recognize evidence is limited and/or
services may not be accessible or desirable.</p>

<p>TGD people, as with all other people seeking
health care, should have the highest quality of care
accessible that is commensurate with the quality
of care provided to all people utilizing health services (The Yogyakarta Principles, 2017). As this
will vary around the globe, the nature of the professional completing an assessment for GAMSTs
will vary according to the nature of health care in
the local setting as well as the regulatory requirements set by licensing and registration boards. It
is important the health care provided includes an
assessment conducted by a competent, statutorily
regulated HCP who has the competence to identify
gender incongruence and conditions that can be
mistaken for gender incongruence and who can
support the TGD person throughout the assessment process (RCGP, 2019). Assessors must be able
to refer to HCPs licensed to provide GAMSTs.</p>
<p>HCPs should have at a minimum a masters-level
qualification in a clinical field related to transgender health or equivalent further clinical training
and be statutorily regulated; examples include a
mental health professional (MHP), general medical
practitioner, nurse, or other qualified HCP. In some
settings, statutorily regulated HCPs with lower levels of qualification may practice under the clinical
supervision of a qualified HCP who takes ultimate
clinical responsibility for the quality and accuracy
of the completed GAMST assessment. For additional information see Chapter 4—Education.</p>
<p>Accessing a competent, statutorily regulated,
HCP with expertise in GAMST assessment can
sometimes be difficult. Consequently, ensuring
continuity of care and minimizing gaps in accessible care or significantly delayed care (e.g., a
long waiting list) may require that a statutorily
regulated HCP without expertise provide care and
support the assessment of a TGD person for
GAMSTs. Avoiding unnecessary delays in care is
critically important. However, TGD people should
be supported to access care with an experienced
HCP as soon as possible (RCGP, 2019).</p>
<p>Established practice requires the competence to
identify and diagnose gender incongruence
(Hembree et al., 2017; Reed et al., 2016; T’Sjoen
et al., 2020) and the ability to identify differentials
or conditions that may be mistaken as gender
incongruence (Byne et al., 2018; Dhejne et al.,
2016; Hembree et al., 2017). Established practice
also strongly emphasizes the need for ongoing continuing education in the assessment and provision
of care of TGD people (American Psychological
Association, 2015; T’Sjoen et al., 2020). For more
information see Chapter 4—Education.</p>

<h3>Statement 5.1.b: For countries requiring a diagnosis for access to care, the health care professional should be competent using the latest edition of the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases (ICD) for diagnosis.<a href="assessment-of-adults.html#statement-5.1.b-for-countries-requiring-a-diagnosis-for-access-to-care-the-health-care-professional-should-be-competent-using-the-latest-edition-of-the-world-health-organizations-international-classification-of-diseases-icd-for-diagnosis." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>In countries that
have not implemented the latest ICD, other taxonomies may be used; efforts should be undertaken to utilize the latest ICD as soon as practicable.
In some countries, a diagnosis of gender incongruence may be necessary to access GAMSTs (as
described below). HCPs assessing TGD people in
those countries should be competent to diagnose
gender incongruence using the most current classification system necessary for TGD people to
access GAMSTs. The ICD-11 (WHO, 2019a) is a
classification system that focuses on the TGD
person’s experienced identity and any need for
GAMSTs and does not consider a TGD identity
to be a mental illness.</p>

<h3>Statement 5.1.c: Are able to identify co-existing mental health or other psychosocial concerns and distinguish these from gender dysphoria, incongruence, and diversity.<a href="assessment-of-adults.html#statement-5.1.c-are-able-to-identify-co-existing-mental-health-or-other-psychosocial-concerns-and-distinguish-these-from-gender-dysphoria-incongruence-and-diversity." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Gender diversity is a natural variation in people
and is not inherently pathological (American
Psychological Association, 2015). However, assessment is best provided by an HCP who possesses
some expertise in mental health in order to identify conditions that can be mistaken for gender
incongruence. Such conditions are rare and, when
present, are often psychological in nature (Byne
et al., 2012; Byne et al., 2018; Hembree et al., 2017).</p>
<p>The need to include an HCP with some expertise
in mental health does not require the inclusion of
a psychologist, psychiatrist, or social worker in each
assessment. Instead, a general medical practitioner,
nurse, or other qualified HCP could also fulfill this
requirement if they have sufficient expertise to identify gender incongruence, recognize mental health
concerns, distinguish between these concerns and
gender dysphoria, incongruence, and diversity, assist
a TGD person in care planning and preparation
for GAMSTs, and refer to a mental health professional (MHP), if needed. As discussed in greater
depth in the mental health chapter, MHPs have an
important role to play in the care of TGD people.
For example, the prejudice and discrimination experienced by some TGD people (Robles et al., 2016)
can lead to depression, anxiety, or worsening of
other mental health conditions. In such cases, an
MHP can diagnose, clarify, and treat mental health
conditions. MHPs and HCPs with expertise in mental health are well-placed to assess for GAMSTs, as
well as to support TGD people who require or
request mental health input or support during their
transition. For additional information see Chapter
18—Mental Health.</p>

<div id="statement-5.1.d-are-able-to-assess-capacity-to-consent-for-treatment." class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Statement 5.1.d: Are able to assess capacity to consent for treatment.<a href="assessment-of-adults.html#statement-5.1.d-are-able-to-assess-capacity-to-consent-for-treatment." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>An assessment for GAMSTs must include an
examination of the TGD person’s ability to consent
to the proposed treatment. Consent requires the
cognitive capacity to understand the risks and
benefits of a treatment and the potential negative
and positive outcomes. It also requires the ability
to retain that information for the purposes of
making the decision (using aids as necessary) as
well as the cognitive ability to use that understanding to make an informed decision (American
Medical Association, 2021; Applebaum, 2007).</p>
<p>Some TGD individuals will have the capacity to
grant consent immediately during the assessment.
Some TGD individuals may need a longer process
to be able to consent through ongoing discussion
and the practice of medical decision-making skills.
The presence of psychiatric illness or mental health
symptoms do not pose a barrier to GAMSTs unless
the psychiatric illness or mental health symptoms
affect the TGD person’s capacity to consent to the
specific treatment being requested or affect their
ability to receive treatment. This is especially important because GAMSTs have been found to reduce
mental health symptomatology for TGD people
(Aldridge et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Health care systems can consider GAMSTs for
individuals who may not be able to directly consent if an appropriate legal guardian or
regulator-approved independent decision maker
with the power to determine health care treatment grants consent and confirms the proposed
treatment is in alignment with the TGD individual’s needs and wishes.</p>

<p>As in any other area of clinical practice, it is vital
HCPs who are providing assessment for the initiation
of GAMSTs are knowledgeable and experienced in
the health care of TGD people. If this is not possible
in the local context, the HCP providing the assessment should work closely with an HCP who is
knowledgeable and experienced. As part of their
clinical practice, HCPs should commit to ongoing
training in TGD health care, become a member of
relevant professional bodies, attend relevant professional meetings, workshops or seminars, consult with
an HCP with relevant experience, and/or engage with
the TGD community. This is particularly important
in TGD health care as it is a relatively new field,
and the knowledge and terminology are constantly
changing (American Psychological Association, 2015;
Thorne, Yip et al., 2019). Consequently, keeping up
to date in the areas of TGD health is vital for anyone
involved in an assessment for GAMSTs.</p>

Hembree et al., 2017; Karasic &amp; Fraser, 2018;
T’Sjoen et al., 2020) with team members who
have timely and adequate contact with one
another. This could include an MHP, an endocrinologist, a primary care provider, a surgeon,
a voice and communication specialist, TGD peer
navigator, and others. In some cases, a multidisciplinary team may not be required; however,
should a multidisciplinary team be needed, it is
critical HCPs be able to access colleagues from
different disciplines in a timely manner to complete the GAMST assessment and best support
the needs of the TGD person. It is also critical
TGD people be supported with follow-up
appointments with any HCP who was involved
during the assessment for GAMSTs, prior to,
during, and after the initiation of gender-affirming
treatments.</p>

<h3>Statement 5.3.a: Only recommend gender-affirming medical treatment requested by a TGD person when the experience of gender incongruence is marked and sustained.<a href="assessment-of-adults.html#statement-5.3.a-only-recommend-gender-affirming-medical-treatment-requested-by-a-tgd-person-when-the-experience-of-gender-incongruence-is-marked-and-sustained." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>To access GAMSTs, a TGD person’s gender
incongruence must be marked and sustained.
This can include a need for GAMSTs and a
desire to be accepted as a person of the experienced gender. Consequently, a consideration
of the nature, length and consistency of gender
incongruence is important. This can include
such factors as a change of name and identity
documents, telling others about one’s gender,
health care documentation, or changes in gender
expression. However, marked and sustained gender incongruence can exist in the absence of
disclosure to others by the TGD person
(Brumbaugh-Johnson &amp; Hull, 2019; Saeed et al.,
2018; Sequeira et al., 2020). An abrupt or superficial change in gender identity or lack of persistence is insufficient to initiate gender- affirming
treatments, and further assessment is recommended. In such circumstances, ongoing assessment is helpful to ensure the consistency and
persistence of gender incongruence before
GAMSTs are initiated.</p>
<p>While marked and sustained gender incongruence should be present, it is not necessary for TGD
people to experience severe levels of distress regarding their gender identity to access gender- affirming
treatments. In fact, access to gender-affirming treatment can act as a prophylactic measure to prevent
distress (Becker et al., 2018; Giovanardi et al., 2021;
Nieder et al., 2021; Nobili et al., 2018; Robles et al.,
2016). A TGD adult can have sustained gender
incongruence without significant distress and still
benefit from GAMSTs.</p>
<p>Established clinical practice examines the persistence of gender incongruence when considering
the initiation of GAMSTs (Chen &amp; Loshak, 2020).
In a review of 200 clinical notes, Jones, Brewin
et al. (2017) identified the importance of the
“stability of gender identity” when planning care.
Providing GAMSTs to TGD people with persistent gender incongruence has been associated
with low rates of patient regret and high rates of
patient satisfaction (Becker et al., 2018; El-Hadi
et al., 2018; Staples et al., 2020; Wiepjes et al.,
2018). However, while the ICD 11 (WHO, 2019a)
requires the presence of marked and persistent
gender incongruence for a diagnosis of gender
incongruence to be made, there is little specific
evidence concerning the length of persistence
required for treatment in adults. HCPs involved
in an assessment of a TGD person for GAMSTs
are encouraged to give due consideration to the
life stage, history, and current circumstances of
the adult being assessed.</p>

<h3>Statement 5.3.b: Ensure fulfillment of diagnostic criteria prior to initiating gender-affirming treatments in regions where a diagnosis is necessary to access health care.<a href="assessment-of-adults.html#statement-5.3.b-ensure-fulfillment-of-diagnostic-criteria-prior-to-initiating-gender-affirming-treatments-in-regions-where-a-diagnosis-is-necessary-to-access-health-care." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>A diagnosis of gender incongruence may be necessary in some regions to access transition-related
care. When a diagnosis is necessary to access
GAMSTs, the assessment for GAMSTs will involve
determining and assigning a diagnosis. In these
instances, HCPs should have competence using the
latest International Classification of Diseases and
Related Health Problems (ICD) (WHO, 2019a). In
regions where a diagnosis is necessary to access
health care, a diagnosis of HA60 Gender Incongruence
of Adolescence or Adulthood should be determined
prior to gender-affirming interventions.
Gender-affirming interventions secondary to a diagnosis of HA6Z Gender Incongruence, Unspecified may
be considered in the context of a more comprehensive assessment by the multidisciplinary team.</p>
<p>There is evidence the use of rigid assessment
tools for “transition readiness” may reduce access
to care and are not always in the best interest of
the TGD person (MacKinnon et al., 2020).
Therefore, in situations where the assignment of
a diagnosis is mandatory to access care, the process should be approached with trust and
transparency between the HCP and the TGD
individual requesting GAMST, with the needs of
the TGD individual in mind. Indeed, high quality
relationships between TGD people and their
HCPs are associated with lower emotional distress
and better outcomes (Kattari et al., 2016). Because
many TGD people fear HCPs will erroneously
conflate transgender identity with mental illness
(Ellis et al., 2015), a diagnostic assessment should
be undertaken with sensitivity to facilitate the
best relationship between the provider and the
TGD individual.</p>

<p>In rare cases, TGD individuals might have a condition that may be mistaken for gender incongruence or may have another reason for seeking
treatment aside from the alleviation of gender incongruence. In these cases, and when there is ambiguity
regarding the diagnosis of gender incongruence, a
more detailed and comprehensive assessment is
important. For example, further assessment might
be required to determine if gender incongruence
persists outside of an acute psychotic episode. If
gender incongruence persists after an acute psychotic
episode resolves, GAMSTs may be considered as
long as the TGD person has the capacity to consent
to and undergo the specific treatment. If gender
incongruence does not persist and only occurs
during such an episode, treatment should not be
considered. It is important such circumstances be
identified and excluded prior to the initiation of
GAMSTs (Byne et al., 2012, 2018; Hembree et al.,
2017). It is important to understand, however, TGD
people may present with gender incongruence and
with a mental health condition, autistic spectrum
disorder, or other neurodiversity (Glidden et al.,
2016). Indeed, some mental health conditions, such
as anxiety (Bouman et al., 2017), depression
(Heylens, Elaut et al., 2014; Witcomb et al., 2018),
and self-harm (Arcelus et al., 2016; Claes et al.,
2015) are more prevalent in TGD people who have
not accessed GAMSTs. Recent longitudinal studies
suggest mental health symptoms experienced by
TGD people tend to improve following GAMSTs
(Aldridge et al., 2020; Heylens, Verroken et al., 2014;
White Hughto &amp; Reisner, 2016). There is no evidence to suggest a benefit of withholding GAMSTs
from TGD people who have gender incongruence
simply on the basis that they have a mental health
or neurodevelopmental condition. For more information see Chapter 18—Mental Health.</p>

<p>Like their cisgender counterparts, TGD people may have mental health problems. Treatment
for mental health problems can and should
occur in conjunction with GAMSTs when medical transition is needed. It is vital
gender-affirming care is not impeded unless, in
some extremely rare cases, there is robust evidence that doing so is necessary to prevent
significant decompensation with a risk of harm
to self or others. In those cases, it is also
important to consider the risks delaying
GAMSTs poses to a TGD person’s mental and
physical health (Byne et al., 2018).</p>
<p>In general, social and medical transition of
TDG people are both associated with a reduction in mental health problems (Aldridge et al.,
2020; Bouman et al., 2017; Durwood et al., 2017;
Glynn et al., 2016; Hughto &amp; Reisner, 2016;
Wilson et al., 2015; Witcomb et al., 2018).
Unfortunately, the loss of social support and the
physical and financial stress that can be associated with the initiation of GAMSTs may exacerbate pre-existing mental health problems and
warrant additional support from the treating
HCP (Budge et al., 2013; Yang, Wang et al.,
2016). An assessment of mental health symptoms can improve transition outcomes, particularly when the assessment is used to facilitate
access to psychological and social support during
transition (Byne et al., 2012). A delay of transition in rare circumstances may be considered
if, for example, the TGD person is unable to
engage with the process of transition or would
be unable to manage aftercare following surgery,
even with support. Where a delay in GAMST
as a last resort has been found to be necessary,
the HCP should offer resources and support to
improve mental health and facilitate
re-engagement with the GAMST process as soon
as practicable. It should be noted access to medical transition for TGD people facilitates social
transition and improves safety in public (Rood
et al., 2017). In turn, the degree to which TGD
people’s appearance conforms to their gender
identity is the best predictor of quality of life
and mental health outcomes following medical
transition (Austin &amp; Goodman, 2017). Delaying
access to GAMSTs due to the presence of mental
health problems may exacerbate symptoms
(Owen-Smith et al., 2018) and damage rapport;
consequently, this should be done only when all
other avenues have been exhausted.</p>

<p>In rare cases, GAMSTs, such as hormonal and
surgical interventions, may have iatrogenic consequences or may exacerbate pre-existing physical
health conditions (Hembree et al., 2017). In these
instances, care should be taken, whenever possible, to manage pre-existing physical health conditions while initiating (if appropriate) or
continuing gender-affirming treatments. Any
interruptions in treatment should be as brief as
possible and with treatment re-initiated as soon
as practicable. Limited data and inconsistent findings suggest an association between cardiovascular and metabolic risks and hormone therapy in
TGD adults (Getahun, 2018; Iwamoto, Defreyne
et al., 2019; Iwamoto et al., 2021; Spanos et al.,
2020). Because of the possible harm related to
long-term treatment and the probable benefits
expected from the preventive measures applied
before and during hormone treatment, a careful
assessment of physical health conditions prior to
initiation of treatment is important. Some specific
conditions, such as a history of hormone-sensitive
cancer, may require further assessment and management that may preclude hormone treatment
(Center of Excellence for Transgender Health,
2016; Hembree et al., 2017).</p>
<p>Similar concerns may be present for TGD
adults who wish to access surgical interventions.
Each gender-affirming surgical intervention has
specific risks and potentially unfavorable consequences (Bryson &amp; Honig, 2019; Nassiri et al.,
2020; Remington et al., 2018). However,
intervention-specific risks associated with the
presence of specific physical conditions have not
been well researched. Thus, the kinds of medical
concerns raised by TGD people during the assessment are typically no different from those of any
other surgical candidate.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration the mental and physical health disparities (Brown &amp; Jones, 2016) and
barriers to health care (Safer et al., 2016) experienced by TGD people, the assessment of physical conditions by HCPs should not be limited
to a history of medical interventions. If the TGD
person has physical health conditions, it is
important these conditions are managed while
initiating or continuing GAMSTs whenever possible. Any interruption in treatment should be
made with a view toward re-initiating treatment
as soon as practicable. It is also important HCPs
develop a treatment strategy for managing physical conditions that facilitates health and promotes consistent adherence to a treatment plan.</p>

<p>The practice of informed consent to treatment
is central to the provision of health care. Informed
consent is couched in the ethical principle that
recipients of health care should understand the
health care they receive and any potential consequences that could result. The importance of
informed consent is embedded in many legislative
and regulatory practices that guide HCPs around
the world (Jefford &amp; Moore, 2008). It is not possible to know all the potential consequences of
a health care treatment; instead, considering what
would be “reasonable” to expect is often used as
a minimum criterion for consent (Jefford &amp;
Moore, 2008; Spatz et al., 2016) and remains the
case with GAMSTs. Being able to consent to a
health care procedure or clinical intervention
requires several complex cognitive processes.
Consent requires the cognitive capacity to understand the risks and benefits of a treatment and
the potential negative and positive outcomes in
addition to the ability to retain that information
for the purposes of making the decision (using
aids as necessary) and the cognitive ability to use
that understanding to make an informed decision
(American Medical Association, 2021; Applebaum,
2007). It is vital the TGD person and the assessing HCP consider a priori the nature of the treatment sought and the potential positive and
negative effects it may have on the biological,
psychological, and social domains of the TGD
person’s life.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize mental illness, in
particular symptoms of cognitive impairment or
psychosis, can impact a person’s ability to grant
consent for GAMSTs (Hostiuc et al., 2018).
However, the presence of such symptoms does
not necessarily equate to an inability to give consent because many people with significant mental
health symptoms are able to understand the risks
and benefits of treatment enough to make an
informed decision (Carpenter et al., 2000).
Instead, it is important a careful assessment is
carried out that examines each TGD person’s
ability to comprehend the nature of the specific
GAMST being considered, consider treatment
options, including risks and benefits, appreciate
the potential short- and long-term consequences
of the decision, and communicate their choice in
order to receive the treatment (Grootens-Wiegers
et al., 2017).</p>
<p>There may be instances in which an individual
lacks the capacity to consent to health care, such
as during an acute episode of psychosis or in
situations where an individual has long-term cognitive impairment. However, limits to capacity to
consent to treatment should not prevent individuals from receiving appropriate GAMSTs. For
some, understanding the risks and benefits may
require the use of repeated explanations in
jargon-free language over time or the use of diagrams to facilitate explanation and aid comprehension. A comprehensive and thorough
assessment undertaken by the multidisciplinary
health care team can further inform this process.
For others, an alternative decision maker, such
as a legal guardian or regulator-approved,
independent decision maker may need to be
appointed. These situations need to be considered
on a case-by-case basis with the aim of ensuring
the most affirmative and least restrictive health
care is provided to the individual. Also see

<p>As gender-affirming medical interventions
often affect reproductive capacity, HCPs should
ensure a TGD person is aware of the implications
for reproduction of the treatments and is familiar
with gamete storage and assistive reproductive
options. Gender-affirming hormone treatments
have been shown to impact reproductive functions and fertility, although the consequences are
heterogenous for people of all birth-assigned
sexes (Adeleye et al., 2019; Jindarak et al., 2018;
Taub et al., 2020). There may be individual differences and fluctuations in these effects on TGD
adults. It is therefore essential that HCPs inform
a TGD person about the possible impact of the
treatment on their reproductive potential during
the assessment and as part of the evaluation of
the person’s capacity to consent for GAMSTs.
Reproductive options should be considered and
discussed prior to the initiation of gender-affirming
treatments. Because the literature is unclear about
the possibility of conception while on hormone
therapy, information about the necessity of using
contraception to avoid unwanted pregnancy and
the different methods of contraception available
may need to be provided (Light et al., 2014;
Schubert &amp; Carey,2020).</p>
<p>Cross-sectional studies in clinical and nonclinical samples from different populations consistently report TGD adults express parental desire
and wish to pursue fertility preservation with
varying rates that are related to age, gender, and
the duration of gender-affirming hormone treatment (Auer et al., 2018; De Sutter et al., 2002;
Defreyne, Van Schuvlenbergh et al., 2020;
Wierckx, Stuyver et al., 2012). In a small sample,
provision of fertility information was found to
have an influence on decision-making related to
the use of fertility preservation (Chen et al.,
2019). Although there was no comparison made
between groups who did and did not receive fertility counseling, high fertility preservation rates
occurred following comprehensive fertility counseling among transgender individuals (Amir
et al., 2020). Further, one study suggested consultation with a specialist reduced regret related
to the decision about whether to pursue fertility
preservation procedures (Vyas et al., 2021). For

<p>Social transition can be extremely beneficial
to many TGD people although not all TGD people are able to socially transition or wish to
socially transition (Bränström &amp; Pachankis, 2021;
Koehler et al., 2018; Nieder, Eyssel et al., 2020).
Consequently, some TGD people seek
gender-affirming interventions after social transition, some before, some during, and some in
the absence of social transition.</p>
<p>Social transition and gender identity disclosure can improve the mental health of a TGD
person seeking gender-affirming interventions
(Hughto et al., 2020; McDowell et al., 2019). In
addition, chest and facial surgeries prior to hormone therapy can facilitate social transition
(Altman, 2012; Davis &amp; Colton Meier, 2014;
Olson-Kennedy, Warus et al. 2018; Van Boerum
et al., 2019). As part of the assessment process,
HCPs should discuss which social role is most
comfortable for the TGD person, if a social transition is planned, and the timing for any planned
social transition (Barker &amp; Wylie, 2008). It is
imperative during the assessment process, HCPs
are respectful of the wide diversity of gendered
social roles, including nonbinary as well as
binary identities and presentations, which vary
according to cultural, local community, and individual understandings.</p>
<p>Not everyone who requests GAMSTs will wish
to or be able to socially transition. Little is known
about TGD people who do not socially transition
before, during, or after medical treatment, as this
has not been systematically studied. The most
frequent reasons that have been identified for
avoiding social transition are fear of being abandoned by family or friends, fearing economic loss
(Bradford et al., 2013), and being discriminated
against and stigmatized (Langenderfer-Magruder
et al., 2016; McDowell et al., 2019; White Hughto
et al., 2015). However, some people do not pursue
social transition because they feel hormonal or
surgical treatments offer enough subjective
improvement to reduce gender dysphoria.</p>
<p>If there is no clear plan for social transition
or if social transition is unwanted, additional
assessment is important to determine the specific
nature and advisability of the treatment request,
especially if surgical treatment is requested.
Additional assessment can offer the TGD person
an opportunity to consider the possible effects
of not socially transitioning while still obtaining
GAMSTs. Given the lack of data on health outcomes for TGD people who do not socially transition (Evans et al., 2021; Levine, 2009; Turban,
Loo et al., 2021), GAMSTs should be approached
cautiously in such circumstances.</p>

<p>Previous versions of the SOC guidelines have
required TGD individuals to be assessed for
GAMSTs by two qualified HCPs. It was believed
having two independent opinions was best practice as it ensured safety for both TGD people
and HCPs. For example, it was assumed that
seeing two HCPs offered assuredness for both
TGD people and their assessing HCPs when pursuing irreversible medical interventions.</p>
<p>However, the limited research in the area indicates two opinions are largely unnecessary. For
example, Jones, Brewin et al. (2017) reviewed the
case notes of experienced HCPs working within
a state-funded gender service and found there
was an overwhelming correlation between both
opinions—arguably making one of them redundant. Further, Bouman et al. (2014) determined
the requirement for two independent assessors
reflected paternalism in health care services and
raised a potential breach of the autonomy of TGD
individuals. The authors posited when clients are
adequately prepared and assessed under the care
of a multidisciplinary team, a second independent
assessment is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Consequently, if written documentation or a
letter is required to recommend gender-affirming
medical and surgical treatment (GAMST), TGD
people seeking treatments including hormones, and
genital, chest, facial and other gender-affirming
surgeries require a single written opinion/signature
from an HCP competent to independently assess
and diagnose (Bouman et al., 2014; Yuan et al,
2021). Further written opinions/signatures may be
requested where there is a specific clinical need.</p>

<p>The Endocrine Society Clinical Practice
Guidelines advise a period of consistent hormone
treatment prior to genital surgery (Hembree
et al., 2017). While there was limited supportive
research, this recommendation was considered to
be good clinical practice as it allows a more
reversible experience prior to the irreversible
experience of surgery. For example, there can be
changes in sexual desire after genital surgery that
removes the testicles (Lawrence, 2005; Wierckx,
Van de Peer et al., 2014). In this context, reversible testosterone suppression can offer a TGD
person a period of time to experience the absence
of testosterone and decide if this feels right for
them. It should be noted the effects of reduced
estrogen on a TGD person’s sexual desire and
functioning following an oophorectomy is less
well documented.</p>
<p>Surgery that removes gonads is an irreversible
procedure that leads to loss of fertility and loss
of the effects of endogenous sex steroids. Both
effects must be discussed as a component of the
assessment process. For additional information
see Chapter 16—Reproductive Health. Of course,
hormones are not clinically indicated for TGD
adults who do not want them or in cases where
they are contraindicated due to health reasons.

<h2>Statement 5.7: We recommend health care professionals assessing adults who wish to detransition and seek gender-related hormone intervention, surgical intervention, or both, utilize a comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment that will include additional viewpoints from experienced health care professionals in transgender health and that considers, together with the individual, the role of social transition as part of the assessment process.<a href="assessment-of-adults.html#statement-5.7-we-recommend-health-care-professionals-assessing-adults-who-wish-to-detransition-and-seek-gender-related-hormone-intervention-surgical-intervention-or-both-utilize-a-comprehensive-multidisciplinary-assessment-that-will-include-additional-viewpoints-from-experienced-health-care-professionals-in-transgender-health-and-that-considers-together-with-the-individual-the-role-of-social-transition-as-part-of-the-assessment-process." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Many TGD adults may consider a range of
identities and elements of gender presentation
while they are exploring their gender identity and
are considering transition options. Accordingly,
people may spend some time in a gender identity
or presentation before they discover it does not
feel comfortable and later adapt it or shift to an
earlier identity or presentation (Turban, King
et al., 2021). Some TGD adults may also experience a change in gender identity over time so
that their needs for medical treatment evolve.
This is a healthy and reasonable process for determining the most comfortable and congruent way
of living, which is informed by the person’s gender identity and the context of their life. This
process of identity exploration should not necessarily be equated with regret, confusion, or poor
decision-making because a TGD adult’s gender
identity may change without devaluing previous
transition decisions (MacKinnon et al., 2021;
Turban, Loo et al., 2021). TGD adults should be
assisted in this exploration and any other changes
in their identity (Expósito-Campos, 2021). While
exploration continues, gender-affirming treatments
that are irreversible should be avoided until clarity
about long-term goals and outcomes is achieved.</p>
<p>The decision to detransition appears to be
rare (Defreyne, Motmans et al., 2017;
Hadje-Moussa et al., 2019; Wiepjes et al., 2018).
Estimates of the number of people who detransition due to a change in identity are likely to
be overinflated due to research blending different cohorts (Expósito-Campos, 2021). For example, detransition research cohorts often include
TGD adults who chose to detransition because
of a change in their identity as well as TGD
adults who chose to detransition without a
change in identity. While little research has been
conducted to systematically examine variables
that correlate with a TGD adult’s decision to
halt a transition process or to detransition, a
recent study found the vast majority of TGD
people who opted to detransition did so due to
external factors, such as stigma and lack of
social support and not because of changes in
gender identity (Turban, King et al., 2021). TGD
adults who have not experienced a change in
identity may choose to halt transition or to
detransition because of oppression, violence, and
social/relational conflict, surgical complications,
health concerns, physical contraindications, a
lack of resources, or dissatisfaction with the
results (Expósito-Campos, 2021). In such cases,
MHPs are well placed to assist the TGD person
with these challenges.</p>
<p>While the choice to detransition is proportionally rare, it is expected an overall increase in the
number of adults who identify as TGD would
result in an increase in the absolute number of
people seeking to halt or reverse a transition.
However, while the absolute numbers may
increase, the percentage of people seeking to halt
or reverse permanent physical changes should
remain static and low. The existence of these rare
requests must not be used as a justification to
interrupt critical, medically necessary care, including hormone and surgical treatments, for the vast
majority of TGD adults.</p>
<p>Due to the limited research in this area, clinical guidance is based primarily on individual
case studies and the expert opinion of HCPs
working with TGD adults (Expósito-Campos,
2021; Richards &amp; Barrett, 2020). Accordingly, if
a TGD adult has undergone permanent physical
changes and seeks to undo them, the assessing
HCP should be a member of a comprehensive
multidisciplinary assessment team. A multidisciplinary team allows for the contribution of additional viewpoints from HCPs experienced in
transgender health. In collaboration with the
TGD adult, the multidisciplinary team is encouraged to thoroughly understand the motivations
for the original treatment and for the decision
to detransition. Any concerns with the previous
physical changes should be carefully explored and
a significant effort made to ensure similar concerns are not replicated by the reversal.</p>
<p>To ensure the greatest likelihood of satisfaction
and comfort with a reversal of permanent physical changes, the TGD adult and the multidisciplinary team should explore the role of social
transition in the assessment and in preparation
for the reversal. In such instances, it is highly
likely a prolonged period of living in role will
be necessary before further physical changes are
recommended. HCPs should support the TGD
adult through any social changes, as well as any
feelings of failure, shame, depression, or guilt in
deciding to make such a change. In addition,
people should be supported in coping with any
prejudice or social difficulties they may have
experienced that could have led to a decision to
detransition or that may have resulted from such
a decision. It is also important to help the person
remain engaged with health care throughout the
process (Narayan et al., 2021).</p>
<p>While available research shows consistent positive outcomes for the majority of TGD adults
who choose to transition (Aldridge et al., 2020;
Byne et al., 2012; Gorin-Lazard et al., 2012;
Owen-Smith et al., 2018; White Hughto &amp;
Reisner, 2016), some TGD adults may decompensate or experience a worsened condition following transition. Little research has been
conducted to systematically examine variables
that correlate with poor or worsened biological,
psychological, or social conditions following
transition (Hall et al., 2021; Littman, 2021);
however, this occurrence appears to be rare
(Hall et al., 2021; Wiepjes et al., 2018). In cases
where people decompensate after physical or
social transition and then remain in a poorer
biological, psychological, or social state than
they were in prior to transition, serious consideration should be given as to whether transition
is helpful at this time, for this person, or both.
In cases where treatment is no longer supported,
assistance should be arranged to support the
person to manage the process of stopping treatment and to manage any concomitant difficulties
(Narayan et al., 2021).</p>
<p>It is vital that people who detransition, for
any reason, be supported. It should be remembered, however, this is a rare occurrence and
the literature shows consistently positive outcomes for the vast majority of TGD adults who
transition to a gender that is comfortable for
them, including those who receive GAMSTs
(Byne et al., 2012; Green &amp; Fleming, 1990;
Lawrence, 2003; Motmans et al., 2012; Van de
Grift, Elaut et al., 2018).</p>

<h2>Historical context and changes since previous Standards of Care<a href="adolescents.html#historical-context-and-changes-since-previous-standards-of-care" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Specialized health care for transgender adolescents began in the 1980s when a few specialized
gender clinics for youth were developed around
the world that served relatively small numbers
of children and adolescents. In more recent years,
there has been a sharp increase in the number
of adolescents requesting gender care (Arnoldussen
et al., 2019; Kaltiala, Bergman et al., 2020). Since
then, new clinics have been founded, but clinical
services in many places have not kept pace with
the increasing number of youth seeking care.
Hence, there are often long waitlists for services,
and barriers to care exist for many transgender
youth around the world (Tollit et al., 2018).</p>
<p>Until recently, there was limited information
regarding the prevalence of gender diversity
among adolescents. Studies from high school
samples indicate much higher rates than earlier
thought, with reports of up to 1.2% of participants identifying as transgender (Clark et al.,
2014) and up to 2.7% or more (e.g., 7–9%) experiencing some level of self-reported gender diversity (Eisenberg et al., 2017; Kidd et al., 2021;
Wang et al., 2020). These studies suggest gender
diversity in youth should no longer be viewed as
rare. Additionally, a pattern of uneven ratios by
assigned sex has been reported in gender clinics,
with adolescents assigned female at birth (AFAB)
initiating care 2.5–7.1 times more frequently as
compared to adolescents who are assigned male
at birth (AMAB) (Aitken et al., 2015; Arnoldussen
et al., 2019; Bauer et al., 2021; de Graaf,
Carmichael et al., 2018; Kaltiala et al., 2015;
Kaltiala, Bergman et al., 2020).</p>
<p>A specific World Professional Association for
Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standards of Care
section dedicated to the needs of children and
adolescents was first included in the 1998 WPATH
Standards of Care, 5th version (Levine et al.,
1998). Youth aged 16 or older were deemed
potentially eligible for gender-affirming medical
care, but only in select cases. The subsequent 6th
(Meyer et al., 2005) and 7th (Coleman et al.,
2012) versions divided medical-affirming treatment for adolescents into three categories and
presented eligibility criteria regarding age/puberty
stage—namely fully reversible puberty delaying
blockers as soon as puberty had started; partially
reversible hormone therapy (testosterone, estrogen) for adolescents at the age of majority, which
was age 16 in certain European countries; and
irreversible surgeries at age 18 or older, except
for chest “masculinizing” mastectomy, which had
an age minimum of 16 years. Additional eligibility criteria for gender-related medical care
included a persistent, long (childhood) history of
gender “non-conformity”/dysphoria, emerging or
intensifying at the onset of puberty; absence or
management of psychological, medical, or social
problems that interfere with treatment; provision
of support for commencing the intervention by
the parents/caregivers; and provision of informed
consent. A chapter dedicated to transgender and
gender diverse (TGD) adolescents, distinct from
the child chapter, has been created for this 8th
edition of the Standards of Care given 1) the
exponential growth in adolescent referral rates;
2) the increased number of studies specific to
adolescent gender diversity-related care; and 3)
the unique developmental and gender-affirming
care issues of this age group.</p>
<p>Non-specific terms for gender-related care are
avoided (e.g., gender-affirming model, gender
exploratory model) as these terms do not represent unified practices, but instead heterogenous
care practices that are defined differently in various settings.</p>

<h2>Adolescence overview<a href="adolescents.html#adolescence-overview" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Adolescence is a developmental period characterized by relatively rapid physical and psychological maturation, bridging childhood and
adulthood (Sanders, 2013). Multiple developmental processes occur simultaneously, including
pubertal-signaled changes. Cognitive, emotional,
and social systems mature, and physical changes
associated with puberty progress. These processes do not all begin and end at the same
time for a given individual, nor do they occur
at the same age for all persons. Therefore, the
lower and upper borders of adolescence are
imprecise and cannot be defined exclusively by
age. For example, physical pubertal changes may
begin in late childhood and executive control
neural systems continue to develop well into the
mid-20s (Ferguson et al., 2021). There is a lack
of uniformity in how countries and governments
define the age of majority (i.e., legal
decision-making status; Dick et al., 2014). While
many specify the age of majority as 18 years of
age, in some countries it is as young as 15 years
(e.g., Indonesia and Myanmar), and in others
as high as 21 years (e.g., the U.S. state of
Mississippi and Singapore).</p>
<p><strong>For clarity, this chapter applies to adolescents
from the start of puberty until the legal age of
majority (in most cases 18 years), however there
are developmental elements of this chapter,
including the importance of parental/caregiver
involvement, that are often relevant for the care
of transitional-aged young adults and should
be considered appropriately.</strong></p>
<p>Cognitive development in adolescence is often
characterized by gains in abstract thinking, complex reasoning, and metacognition (i.e., a young
person’s ability to think about their own feelings
in relation to how others perceive them; Sanders,
2013). The ability to reason hypothetical situations enables a young person to conceptualize
implications regarding a particular decision.
However, adolescence is also often associated with
increased risk-taking behaviors. Along with these
notable changes, adolescence is often characterized by individuation from parents and the development of increased personal autonomy. There
is often a heightened focus on peer relationships,
which can be both positive and detrimental
(Gardner &amp; Steinberg, 2005). Adolescents often
experience a sense of urgency that stems from
hypersensitivity to reward, and their sense of
timing has been shown to be different from that
of older individuals (Van Leijenhorst et al., 2010).
Social-emotional development typically advances
during adolescence, although there is a great variability among young people in terms of the level
of maturity applied to inter- and intra-personal
communication and insight (Grootens-Wiegers
et al., 2017). For TGD adolescents making decisions about gender-affirming treatments—decisions that may have lifelong consequences—it is
critical to understand how all these aspects of
development may impact decision-making for a
given young person within their specific cultural
context.</p>

<div id="gender-identity-development-in-adolescence" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Gender identity development in adolescence<a href="adolescents.html#gender-identity-development-in-adolescence" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Our understanding of gender identity development in adolescence is continuing to evolve.
When providing clinical care to gender diverse
young people and their families, it is important
to know what is and is not known about gender
identity during development (Berenbaum, 2018).
When considering treatments, families may have
questions regarding the development of their
adolescent’s gender identity, and whether or not
their adolescent’s declared gender will remain
the same over time. For some adolescents, a
declared gender identity that differs from the
assigned sex at birth comes as no surprise to
their parents/caregivers as their history of gender diverse expression dates back to childhood
(Leibowitz &amp; de Vries, 2016). For others, the
declaration does not happen until the emergence
of pubertal changes or even well into adolescence (McCallion et al., 2021; Sorbara
et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Historically, social learning and cognitive
developmental research on gender development
was conducted primarily with youth who were
not gender diverse in identity or expression and
was carried out under the assumption that sex
correlated with a specific gender; therefore, little
attention was given to gender identity development. In addition to biological factors influencing
gender development, this research demonstrated
psychological and social factors also play a role
(Perry &amp; Pauletti, 2011). While there has been
less focus on gender identity development in
TGD youth, there is ample reason to suppose,
apart from biological factors, psychosocial factors
are also involved (Steensma, Kreukels et al.,
2013). For some youth, gender identity development appears fixed and is often expressed from
a young age, while for others there may be a
developmental process that contributes to gender
identity development over time.</p>
<p>Neuroimaging studies, genetic studies, and
other hormone studies in intersex individuals
demonstrate a biological contribution to the
development of gender identity for some
individuals whose gender identity does not match
their assigned sex at birth (Steensma, Kreukels
et al., 2013). As families often have questions
about this very issue, it is important to note it
is not possible to distinguish between those for
whom gender identity may seem fixed from birth
and those for whom gender identity development
appears to be a developmental process. Since it
is impossible to definitively delineate the contribution of various factors contributing to gender
identity development for any given young person,
a comprehensive clinical approach is important
and necessary (see Statement 3). Future research
would shed more light on gender identity development if conducted over long periods of time
with diverse cohort groups. Conceptualization of
gender identity by shifting from dichotomous
(e.g., binary) categorization of male and female
to a dimensional gender spectrum along a continuum (APA, 2013) would also be necessary.</p>
<p>Adolescence may be a critical period for the
development of gender identity for gender diverse
young people (Steensma, Kreukels et al., 2013).
Dutch longitudinal clinical follow-up studies of
adolescents with childhood gender dysphoria who
received puberty suppression, gender-affirming
hormones, or both, found that none of the youth
in adulthood regretted the decisions they had
taken in adolescence (Cohen-Kettenis &amp; van
Goozen, 1997; de Vries et al., 2014). These findings suggest adolescents who were comprehensively assessed and determined emotionally
mature enough to make treatment decisions
regarding gender- affirming medical care presented with stability of gender identity over the
time period when the studies were conducted.</p>
<p>When extrapolating findings from the
longer-term longitudinal Dutch cohort studies to
present-day gender diverse adolescents seeking care,
it is critical to consider the societal changes that
have occurred over time in relation to TGD people.
Given the increase in visibility of TGD identities,
it is important to understand how increased awareness may impact gender development in different
ways (Kornienko et al., 2016). One trend identified
is that more young people are presenting to gender
clinics with nonbinary identities (Twist &amp; de Graaf,
2019). Another phenomenon occurring in clinical
practice is the increased number of adolescents
seeking care who have not seemingly experienced,
expressed (or experienced and expressed) gender
diversity during their childhood years. One
researcher attempted to study and describe a specific form of later-presenting gender diversity experience (Littman, 2018). However, the findings of
the study must be considered within the context
of significant methodological challenges, including
1) the study surveyed parents and not youth perspectives; and 2) recruitment included parents from
community settings in which treatments for gender
dysphoria are viewed with scepticism and are criticized. However, these findings have not been replicated. For a select subgroup of young people,
susceptibility to social influence impacting gender
may be an important differential to consider
(Kornienko et al., 2016). However, caution must
be taken to avoid assuming these phenomena occur
prematurely in an individual adolescent while relying on information from datasets that may have
been ascertained with potential sampling bias
(Bauer et al., 2022; WPATH, 2018). It is important
to consider the benefits that social connectedness
may have for youth who are linked with supportive
people (Tuzun et al., 2022)(see Statement 4).</p>
<p>Given the emerging nature of knowledge
regarding adolescent gender identity development,
an individualized approach to clinical care is considered both ethical and necessary. As is the case
in all areas of medicine, each study has methodological limitations, and conclusions drawn from
research cannot and should not be universally
applied to all adolescents. This is also true when
grappling with common parental questions
regarding the stability versus instability of a particular young person’s gender identity development. While future research will help advance
scientific understanding of gender identity development, there may always be some gaps.
Furthermore, given the ethics of self-determination
in care, these gaps should not leave the TGD
adolescent without important and necessary care.</p>

<h2>Research evidence of gender-affirming medical treatment for transgender adolescents<a href="adolescents.html#research-evidence-of-gender-affirming-medical-treatment-for-transgender-adolescents" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>A key challenge in adolescent transgender care is
the quality of evidence evaluating the effectiveness
of medically necessary gender-affirming medical
and surgical treatments (GAMSTs) (see medically
necessary statement in the Global chapter,
Statement 2.1), over time. Given the lifelong implications of medical treatment and the young age
at which treatments may be started, adolescents,
their parents, and care providers should be
informed about the nature of the evidence base.
It seems reasonable that decisions to move forward
with medical and surgical treatments should be
made carefully. Despite the slowly growing body
of evidence supporting the effectiveness of early
medical intervention, the number of studies is still
low, and there are few outcome studies that follow
youth into adulthood. Therefore, a systematic
review regarding outcomes of treatment in adolescents is not possible. A short narrative review
is provided instead.</p>
<p>At the time of this chapter’s writing, there were
several longer-term longitudinal cohort follow-up
studies reporting positive results of early (i.e.,
adolescent) medical treatment; for a significant
period of time, many of these studies were conducted through one Dutch clinic (e.g.,
Cohen-Kettenis &amp; van Goozen, 1997; de Vries,
Steensma et al., 2011; de Vries et al., 2014; Smith
et al., 2001, 2005). The findings demonstrated
the resolution of gender dysphoria is associated
with improved psychological functioning and
body image satisfaction. Most of these studies
followed a pre-post methodological design and
compared baseline psychological functioning with
outcomes after the provision of medical
gender-affirming treatments. Different studies
evaluated individual aspects or combinations of
treatment interventions and included 1)
gender-affirming hormones and surgeries
(Cohen-Kettenis &amp; van Goozen, 1997; Smith
et al., 2001, 2005); 2) puberty suppression (de
Vries, Steensma et al., 2011); and 3) puberty suppression, affirming hormones, and surgeries (de
Vries et al., 2014). The 2014 long-term follow-up
study is the only study that followed youth from
early adolescence (pretreatment, mean age of
13.6) through young adulthood (posttreatment,
mean age of 20.7). This was the first study to
show gender-affirming treatment enabled transgender adolescents to make age-appropriate
developmental transitions while living as their
affirmed gender with satisfactory objective and
subjective outcomes in adulthood (de Vries et al.,
2014). While the study employed a small (n =
55), select, and socially supported sample, the
results were convincing. Of note, the participants
were part of the Dutch clinic known for employing a multidisciplinary approach, including provision of comprehensive, ongoing assessment and
management of gender dysphoria, and support
aimed at emotional well-being.</p>
<p>Several more recently published longitudinal
studies followed and evaluated participants at
different stages of their gender-affirming treatments. In these studies, some participants may
not have started gender-affirming medical treatments, some had been treated with puberty suppression, while still others had started
gender-affirming hormones or had even undergone gender-affirming surgery (GAS) (Achille
et al., 2020; Allen et al., 2019; Becker-Hebly et al.,
2021; Carmichael et al., 2021; Costa et al., 2015;
Kuper et al., 2020, Tordoff et al., 2022). Given
the heterogeneity of treatments and methods, this
type of design makes interpreting outcomes more
challenging. Nonetheless, when compared with
baseline assessments, the data consistently demonstrate improved or stable psychological functioning, body image, and treatment satisfaction
varying from three months to up to two years
from the initiation of treatment.</p>
<p>Cross-sectional studies provide another design
for evaluating the effects of gender-affirming
treatments. One such study compared psychological functioning in transgender adolescents at
baseline and while undergoing puberty suppression with that of cisgender high school peers at
two different time points. At baseline, the transgender youth demonstrated lower psychological
functioning compared with cisgender peers,
whereas when undergoing puberty suppression,
they demonstrated better functioning than their
peers (van der Miesen et al., 2020). Grannis et al.
(2021) demonstrated transgender males who
started testosterone had lower internalizing mental health symptoms (depression and anxiety)
compared with those who had not started testosterone treatment.</p>
<p>Four additional studies followed different outcome designs. In a retrospective chart study,
Kaltiala, Heino et al. (2020) reported transgender
adolescents with few or no mental health challenges prior to commencing gender-affirming
hormones generally did well during the treatment. However, adolescents with more mental
health challenges at baseline continued to experience the manifestations of those mental health
challenges over the course of gender-affirming
medical treatment. Nieder et al. (2021) studied
satisfaction with care as an outcome measure and
demonstrated transgender adolescents were more
satisfied the further they progressed with the
treatments they initially started. Hisle-Gorman
et al. (2021) compared health care utilization preand post-initiation of gender-affirming pharmaceuticals as indicators of the severity of mental
health conditions among 3,754 TGD adolescents
in a large health care data set. Somewhat contrary
to the authors’ hypothesis of improved mental
health, mental health care use did not significantly change, and psychotropic medication prescriptions increased. In a large non-probability
sample of transgender-identified adults, Turban
et al. (2022) found those who reported access to
gender-affirming hormones in adolescence had
lower odds of past-year suicidality compared with
transgender people accessing gender- affirming
hormones in adulthood.</p>
<p>Providers may consider the possibility an adolescent may regret gender-affirming decisions
made during adolescence, and a young person
will want to stop treatment and return to living
in the birth-assigned gender role in the future.
Two Dutch studies report low rates of adolescents (1.9% and 3.5%) choosing to stop puberty
suppression (Brik et al., 2019; Wiepjes et al.,
2018). Again, these studies were conducted in
clinics that follow a protocol that includes a
comprehensive assessment before the
gender-affirming medical treatment is started.
At present, no clinical cohort studies have
reported on profiles of adolescents who regret
their initial decision or detransition after irreversible affirming treatment. Recent research
indicate there are adolescents who detransition,
but do not regret initiating treatment as they
experienced the start of treatment as a part of
understanding their gender-related care needs
(Turban, 2018). However, this may not be the
predominant perspective of people who
detransition (Littman, 2021; Vandenbussche,
2021). Some adolescents may regret the steps
they have taken (Dyer, 2020). Therefore, it is
important to present the full range of possible
outcomes when assisting transgender adolescents. Providers may discuss this topic in a collaborative and trusting manner (i.e., as a
“potential future experience and consideration”)
with the adolescent and their parents/caregivers
before gender-affirming medical treatments are
started. Also, providers should be prepared to
support adolescents who detransition. In an
internet convenience sample survey of 237
self-identified detransitioners with a mean age
of 25.02 years, which consisted of over 90% of
birth assigned females, 25% had medically transitioned before age 18 and 14% detransitioned
before age 18 (Vandenbussche, 2021). Although
an internet convenience sample is subject to
selection of respondents, this study suggests
detransitioning may occur in young transgender
adolescents and health care professionals should
be aware of this. Many of them expressed difficulties finding help during their detransition
process and reported their detransition was an
isolating experience during which they did not
receive either sufficient or appropriate support
(Vandenbussche, 2021).</p>
<p>To conclude, although the existing samples
reported on relatively small groups of youth (e.g.,
n = 22-101 per study) and the time to follow-up
varied across studies (6 months–7 years), this
emerging evidence base indicates a general
improvement in the lives of transgender adolescents who, following careful assessment, receive
medically necessary gender-affirming medical
treatment. Further, rates of reported regret during
the study monitoring periods are low. Taken as
a whole, the data show early medical intervention—as part of broader combined assessment
and treatment approaches focused on gender dysphoria and general well-being—can be effective
and helpful for many transgender adolescents
seeking these treatments.</p>

<p>Medical ethics and human rights perspectives
were also considered while formulating the
adolescent SOC statements. For example, allowing irreversible puberty to progress in adolescents who experience gender incongruence is
not a neutral act given that it may have immediate and lifelong harmful effects for the transgender young person (Giordano, 2009; Giordano
&amp; Holm, 2020; Kreukels &amp; Cohen-Kettenis,
2011). From a human rights perspective, considering gender diversity as a normal and
expected variation within the broader diversity
of the human experience, it is an adolescent’s
right to participate in their own decision-making
process about their health and lives, including
access to gender health services (Amnesty
International, 2020).</p>

<p>These guidelines are designed to account for what
is known and what is not known about gender
identity development in adolescence, the evidence
for gender-affirming care in adolescence, and the
unique aspects that distinguish adolescence from
other developmental stages.</p>
<p><em>Identity exploration:</em> A defining feature of adolescence
is the solidifying of aspects of identity, including gender identity. Statement 6.2 addresses identity exploration in the context of gender identity development.
Statement 6.12.b accounts for the length of time
needed for a young person to experience a gender
diverse identity, express a gender diverse identity, or
both, so as to make a meaningful decision regarding
gender-affirming care.</p>
<p><em>Consent and decision-making:</em> In adolescence, consent
and decision-making require assessment of the individual’s emotional, cognitive, and psychosocial development. Statement 6.12.c directly addresses emotional
and cognitive maturity and describes the necessary
components of the evaluation process used to assess
decision-making capacity.</p>
<p><em>Caregivers/parent involvement:</em> Adolescents are typically dependent on their caregivers/parents for
guidance in numerous ways. This is also true as
the young person navigates through the process of
deciding about treatment options. Statement 6.11
addresses the importance of involving caregivers/
parents and discusses the role they play in the
assessment and treatment. No set of guidelines can
account for every set of individual circumstances
on a global scale.</p>

</ol>
<p>When assessing and supporting TGD adolescents and their families, care providers/health
care professionals (HCPs) need both general as
well as gender-specific knowledge and training.
Providers who are trained to work with adolescents and families play an important role in navigating aspects of adolescent development and
family dynamics when caring for youth and families (Adelson et al., 2012; American Psychological
Association, 2015; Hembree et al., 2017). Other
chapters in these standards of care describe these
criteria for professionals who provide gender care
in more detail (see Chapter 5—Assessment for
Adults; Chapter 7—Children; or Chapter 13—
Surgery and Postoperative Care). Professionals
working with adolescents should understand
what is and is not known regarding adolescent
gender identity development, and how this
knowledge base differs from what applies to
adults and prepubertal children. Among HCPs,
the mental health professional (MHP) has the
most appropriate training and dedicated clinical
time to conduct an assessment and elucidate
treatment priorities and goals when working with
transgender youth, including those seeking
gender-affirming medical/surgical care.
Understanding and managing the dynamics of
family members who may share differing perspectives regarding the history and needs of the
young person is an important competency that
MHPs are often most prepared to address.
When access to professionals trained in child
and adolescent development is not possible, HCPs
should make a commitment to obtain training in
the areas of family dynamics and adolescent development, including gender identity development.
Similarly, considering autistic/neurodivergent
transgender youth represent a substantial minority
subpopulation of youth served in gender clinics
globally, it is important HCPs seek additional
training in the field of autism and understand the
unique elements of care autistic gender diverse
youth may require (Strang, Meagher et al., 2018).
If these qualifications are not possible, then consultation and collaboration with a provider who
specializes in autism and neurodiversity is advised.</p>

<h2>Statement 6.2: We recommend health care professionals working with gender diverse adolescents facilitate the exploration and expression of gender openly and respectfully so that no one particular identity is favored.<a href="adolescents.html#statement-6.2-we-recommend-health-care-professionals-working-with-gender-diverse-adolescents-facilitate-the-exploration-and-expression-of-gender-openly-and-respectfully-so-that-no-one-particular-identity-is-favored." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Adolescence is a developmental period that
involves physical and psychological changes characterized by individuation and the transition to
independence from caregivers (Berenbaum et al.,
2015; Steinberg, 2009). It is a period during
which young people may explore different aspects
of identity, including gender identity.</p>
<p>Adolescents differ regarding the degree to
which they explore and commit to aspects of
their identity (Meeus et al., 2012). For some adolescents, the pace to achieving consolidation of
identity is fast, while for others it is slower. For
some adolescents, physical, emotional, and psychological development occur over the same general timeline, while for others, there are certain
gaps between these aspects of development.
Similarly, there is variation in the timeline for
gender identity development (Arnoldussen et al.,
2020; Katz-Wise et al., 2017). For some young
people, gender identity development is a clear
process that starts in early childhood, while for
others pubertal changes contribute to a person’s
experience of themselves as a particular gender
(Steensma, Kreukels et al., 2013), and for many
others a process may begin well after pubertal
changes are completed. Given these variations,
there is no one particular pace, process, or outcome that can be predicted for an individual
adolescent seeking gender-affirming care.</p>
<p>Therefore, HCPs working with adolescents
should promote supportive environments that
simultaneously respect an adolescent’s affirmed
gender identity and also allows the adolescent to
openly explore gender needs, including social,
medical, and physical gender-affirming interventions should they change or evolve over time.</p>

<h2>Statement 6.3: We recommend health care professionals working with gender diverse adolescents undertake a comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment of adolescents who present with gender identity-related concerns and seek medical/surgical transition-related care, and that this be accomplished in a collaborative and supportive manner.<a href="adolescents.html#statement-6.3-we-recommend-health-care-professionals-working-with-gender-diverse-adolescents-undertake-a-comprehensive-biopsychosocial-assessment-of-adolescents-who-present-with-gender-identity-related-concerns-and-seek-medicalsurgical-transition-related-care-and-that-this-be-accomplished-in-a-collaborative-and-supportive-manner." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Given the many ways identity may unfold
during adolescence, we recommend using a comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment to guide
treatment decisions and optimize outcomes. This
assessment should aim to understand the adolescent’s strengths, vulnerabilities, diagnostic profile,
and unique needs to individualize their care. As
mentioned in Statement 6.1, MHPs have the most
appropriate training, experience, and dedicated
clinical time required to obtain the information
discussed here. The assessment process should
be approached collaboratively with the adolescent
and their caregiver(s), both separately and
together, as described in more detail in Statement
6.11. An assessment should occur prior to any
medically necessary medical or surgical intervention under consideration (e.g., puberty blocking
medication, gender-affirming hormones, surgeries). See medically necessary statement in Chapter
2—Global Applicability, Statement 2.1; see also
Chapter 12—Hormone Therapy and Chapter 13—
Surgery and Postoperative Care.</p>
<p>Youth may experience many different gender
identity trajectories. Sociocultural definitions and
experiences of gender continue to evolve over
time, and youth are increasingly presenting with
a range of identities and ways of describing their
experiences and gender-related needs (Twist &amp; de
Graaf, 2019). For example, some youth will realize
they are transgender or more broadly gender
diverse and pursue steps to present accordingly.
For some youth, obtaining gender-affirming medical treatment is important while for others these
steps may not be necessary. For example, a process
of exploration over time might not result in the
young person self-affirming or embodying a different gender in relation to their assigned sex at
birth and would not involve the use of medical
interventions (Arnoldussen et al., 2019).</p>
<p>The most robust longitudinal evidence supporting the benefits of gender-affirming medical and
surgical treatments in adolescence was obtained
in a clinical setting that incorporated a detailed
comprehensive diagnostic assessment process over
time into its delivery of care protocol (de Vries &amp;
Cohen-Kettenis, 2012; de Vries et al., 2014). Given
this research and the ongoing evolution of gender
diverse experiences in society, a comprehensive
diagnostic biopsychosocial assessment during adolescence is both evidence-based and preserves the
integrity of the decision-making process. In the
absence of a full diagnostic profile, other mental
health entities that need to be prioritized and
treated may not be detected. There are no studies
of the long-term outcomes of gender-related medical treatments for youth who have not undergone
a comprehensive assessment. Treatment in this
context (e.g., with limited or no assessment) has
no empirical support and therefore carries the risk
that the decision to start gender-affirming medical
interventions may not be in the long-term best
interest of the young person at that time.</p>
<p>As delivery of health care and access to specialists varies globally, designing a particular
assessment process to adapt existing resources is
often necessary. In some cases, a more extended
assessment process may be useful, such as for
youth with more complex presentations (e.g., complicating mental health histories (Leibowitz &amp; de
Vries, 2016)), co-occurring autism spectrum characteristics (Strang, Powers et al., 2018), and/or an
absence of experienced childhood gender incongruence (Ristori &amp; Steensma, 2016). Given the
unique cultural, financial, and geographical factors
that exist for specific populations, providers should
design assessment models that are flexible and
allow for appropriately timed care for as many
young people as possible, so long as the assessment effectively obtains information about the
adolescent’s strengths, vulnerabilities, diagnostic
profile, and individual needs. Psychometrically validated psychosocial and gender measures can also
be used to provide additional information.</p>

<p>Multiple studies and related expert consensus
support the implementation of approaches that
promote acceptance and affirmation of gender
diverse youth across all settings, including families, schools, health care facilities, and all other
organizations and communities with which they
interact (e.g., Pariseau et al., 2019; Russell et al.,
2018; Simons et al., 2013; Toomey et al., 2010;
Travers et al., 2012). Acceptance and affirmation
are accomplished through a range of approaches,
actions, and policies we recommend be enacted
across the various relationships and settings in
which a young person exists and functions. It is
important for the family members and community members involved in the adolescent’s life to
work collaboratively in these efforts unless their
involvement is considered harmful to the adolescent. Examples proposed by Pariseau et al. (2019)
and others of acceptance and affirmation of gender diversity and contemplation and expression
of identity that can be implemented by family,
staff, and organizations include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Actions that are supportive of youth drawn to engaging in gender-expansive (e.g., nonconforming) activities and interests;</li>
<li>Communications that are supportive when youth express their experiences about their gender and gender exploration;</li>
<li>Use of the youth’s asserted name/pronouns;</li>
<li>Support for youth wearing clothing/uniforms, hairstyles, and items (e.g., jewelry, makeup) they feel affirm their gender;</li>
<li>Positive and supportive communication with youth about their gender and gender concerns;</li>
<li>Education about gender diversity issues for people in the young person’s life (e.g., family members, health care providers, social support networks), as needed, including information about how to advocate for gender diverse youth in community, school, health care, and other settings;</li>
<li>Support for gender diverse youth to connect with communities of support (e.g., LGBTQ groups, events, friends);</li>
<li>Provision of opportunities to discuss, consider, and explore medical treatment options when indicated;</li>
<li>Antibullying policies that are enforced;</li>
<li>Inclusion of nonbinary experiences in daily life, reading materials, and curricula (e.g., books, health, and sex education classes, assigned essay topics that move beyond the binary, LGBTQ, and ally groups);</li>
<li>Gender inclusive facilities that the youth can readily access without segregation from nongender diverse peers (e.g., bathrooms, locker rooms).</li>
</ol>
<p>We recommend HCPs work with parents,
schools, and other organizations/groups to promote acceptance and affirmation of TGD identities
and expressions, whether social or medical interventions are implemented or not as acceptance
and affirmation are associated with fewer negative
mental health and behavioral symptoms and more
positive mental health and behavioral functioning
(Day et al., 2015; de Vries et al., 2016; Greytak
et al., 2013; Pariseau et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2019;
Russell et al., 2018; Simons et al., 2013; Taliaferro
et al., 2019; Toomey et al., 2010; Travers et al.,
2012). Russell et al. (2018) found mental health
improvement increases with more acceptance and
affirmation across more settings (e.g., home,
school, work, and friends). Rejection by family,
peers, and school staff (e.g., intentionally using
the name and pronoun the youth does not identify
with, not acknowledging affirmed gender identity,
bullying, harassment, verbal and physical abuse,
poor relationships, rejection for being TGD, eviction) was strongly linked to negative outcomes,
such as anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and substance use (Grossman et al.,
2005; Klein &amp; Golub; 2016; Pariseau et al., 2019;
Peng et al., 2019; Reisner, Greytak et al., 2015;
Roberts et al., 2013). It is important to be aware
that negative symptoms increase with increased
levels of rejection and continue into adulthood
(Roberts et al., 2013).</p>
<p>Neutral or indifferent responses to a youth’s
gender diversity and exploration (e.g., letting a
child tell others their chosen name but not using
the name, not telling family or friends when the
youth wants them to disclose, not advocating
for the child about rejecting behavior from
school staff or peers, not engaging or participating in other support mechanisms (e.g., with
psychotherapists and support groups) have also
been found to have negative consequences, such
as increased depressive symptoms (Pariseau
et al., 2019). For these reasons, it is important
not to ignore a youth’s gender questioning or
delay consideration of the youth’s gender-related
care needs. There is particular value in professionals recognizing youth need individualized
approaches, support, and consideration of needs
around gender expression, identity, and embodiment over time and across domains and relationships. Youth may need help coping with the
tension of tolerating others’ processing/adjusting
to an adolescent’s identity exploration and
changes (e.g., Kuper, Lindley et al., 2019). It is
important professionals collaborate with parents
and others as they process their concerns and
feelings and educate themselves about gender
diversity because such processes may not necessarily reflect rejection or neutrality but may
rather represent efforts to develop attitudes and
gather information that foster acceptance (e.g.,
Katz-Wise et al., 2017).</p>

<p>Some health care providers, secular or religious organizations, and rejecting families may
undertake efforts to thwart an adolescent’s
expression of gender diversity or assertion of a
gender identity other than the expression and
behavior that conforms to the sex assigned at
birth. Such efforts at blocking reversible social
expression or transition may include choosing
not to use the youth’s identified name and pronouns or restricting self-expression in clothing
and hairstyles (Craig et al., 2017; Green et al.,
2020). These disaffirming behaviors typically
aim to reinforce views that a young person’s
gender identity/expression must match the gender associated with the sex assigned at birth or
expectations based on the sex assigned at birth.
Activities and approaches (sometimes referred
to as “treatments”) aimed at trying to change a
person’s gender identity and expression to
become more congruent with the sex assigned
at birth have been attempted, but these
approaches have not resulted in changes in gender identity (Craig et al., 2017; Green et al.,
2020). We recommend against such efforts
because they have been found to be ineffective
and are associated with increases in mental illness and poorer psychological functioning (Craig
et al., 2017; Green et al., 2020; Turban, Beckwith
et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Much of the research evaluating “conversion
therapy” and “reparative therapy” has investigated
the impact of efforts to change gender expression
(masculinity or femininity) and has conflated
sexual orientation with gender identity (APA,
2009; Burnes et al., 2016; Craig et al., 2017).
Some of these efforts have targeted both gender
identity and expression (AACAP, 2018).
Conversion/reparative therapy has been linked to
increased anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation,
suicide attempts, and health care avoidance (Craig
et al., 2017; Green et al., 2020; Turban, Beckwith
et al., 2020). Although some of these studies have
been criticized for their methodologies and conclusions (e.g., D’Angelo et al., 2020), this should
not detract from the importance of emphasizing
efforts undertaken a priori to change a person’s
identity are clinically and ethically unsound. We
recommend against any type of conversion or
attempts to change a person’s gender identity
because 1) both secular and religion-based efforts
to change gender identity/expression have been
associated with negative psychological functioning
that endures into adulthood (Turban, Beckwith
et al., 2020); and 2) larger ethical reasons exist
that should underscore respect for gender diverse
identities.</p>
<p>It is important to note potential factors driving
a young person’s gender-related experience and
report of gender incongruence, when carried out
in the context of supporting an adolescent with
self-discovery, is not considered reparative therapy as long as there is no a priori goal to change
or promote one particular gender identity or
expression (AACAP, 2018; see Statement 6.2). To
ensure these explorations are therapeutic, we recommend employing affirmative consideration and
supportive tone in discussing what steps have
been tried, considered, and planned for a youth’s
gender expression. These discussion topics may
include what felt helpful or affirming, what felt
unhelpful or distressing and why. We recommend
employing affirmative responses to these steps
and discussions, such as those identified in
SOC-8 Statement 6.4.</p>

<p>TGD youth may experience distress related to
chest and genital anatomy. Practices such as chest
binding, chest padding, genital tucking, and genital packing are reversible, nonmedical interventions that may help alleviate this distress
(Callen-Lorde, 2020a, 2020b; Deutsch, 2016a;
Olson-Kennedy, Rosenthal et al., 2018; Transcare
BC, 2020). It is important to assess the degree
of distress related to physical development or
anatomy, educate youth about potential nonmedical interventions to address this distress, and
discuss the safe use of these interventions.</p>
<p>Chest binding involves compression of the
breast tissue to create a flatter appearance of the
chest. Studies suggest that up to 87% of trans
masculine patients report a history of binding
(Jones, 2015; Peitzmeier, 2017). Binding methods
may include the use of commercial binders,
sports bras, layering of shirts, layering of sports
bras, or the use of elastics or other bandages
(Peitzmeier, 2017). Currently, most youth report
learning about binding practices from online
communities composed of peers (Julian,
2019). Providers can play an important role in
ensuring youth receive accurate and reliable
information about the potential benefits and risks
of chest binding. Additionally, providers can
counsel patients about safe binding practices and
monitor for potential negative health effects.
While there are potential negative physical
impacts of binding, youth who bind report many
benefits, including increased comfort, improved
safety, and lower rates of misgendering (Julian,
2019). Common negative health impacts of chest
binding in youth include back/chest pain, shortness of breath, and overheating (Julian, 2019).
More serious negative health impacts such as skin
infections, respiratory infections, and rib fractures
are uncommon and have been associated with
chest binding in adults (Peitzmeier, 2017). If
binding is employed, youth should be advised to
use only those methods considered safe for binding—such as binders specifically designed for the
gender diverse population—to reduce the risk of
serious negative health effects. Methods that are
considered unsafe for binding include the use of
duct tape, ace wraps, and plastic wrap as these
can restrict blood flow, damage skin, and restrict
breathing. If youth report negative health
impacts from chest binding, these should ideally
be addressed by a gender-affirming medical provider with experience working with TGD youth.</p>
<p>Genital tucking is the practice of positioning
the penis and testes to reduce the outward
appearance of a genital bulge. Methods of tucking
include tucking the penis and testes between the
legs or tucking the testes inside the inguinal canal
and pulling the penis back between the legs.
Typically, genitals are held in place by underwear
or a gaff, a garment that can be made or purchased. Limited studies are available on the specific risks and benefits of tucking in adults, and
none have been carried out in youth. Previous
studies have reported tight undergarments are
associated with decreased sperm concentration
and motility. In addition, elevated scrotal temperatures can be associated with poor sperm
characteristics, and genital tucking could theoretically affect spermatogenesis and fertility
(Marsh, 2019) although there are no definitive
studies evaluating these adverse outcomes. Further
research is needed to determine the specific benefits and risks of tucking in youth.</p>

<p>When discussing the available options of
menstrual-suppressing medications with gender
diverse youth, providers should engage in shared
decision-making, use gender-inclusive language
(e.g., asking patients which terms they utilize to
refer to their menses, reproductive organs, and
genitalia) and perform physical exams in a sensitive, gender-affirmative manner (Bonnington
et al., 2020; Krempasky et al., 2020). There is no
formal research evaluating how menstrual
suppression may impact gender incongruence
and/or dysphoria. However, the use of menstrual
suppression can be an initial intervention that
allows for further exploration of gender-related
goals of care, prioritization of other mental health
care, or both, especially for those who experience
a worsening of gender dysphoria from unwanted
uterine bleeding (see Statement 6.12d; Mehringer
&amp; Dowshen, 2019). When testosterone is not
used, menstrual suppression can be achieved via
a progestin. To exclude any underlying menstrual
disorders, it is important to obtain a detailed
menstrual history and evaluation prior to implementing menstrual-suppressing therapy (Carswell
&amp; Roberts, 2017). As part of the discussion about
menstrual-suppressing medications, the need for
contraception and information regarding the
effectiveness of menstrual-suppressing medications as methods of contraception also need to
be addressed (Bonnington et al., 2020). A variety
of menstrual suppression options, such as combined estrogen-progestin medications, oral progestins, depot and subdermal progestin, and
intrauterine devices (IUDs), should be offered to
allow for individualized treatment plans while
properly considering availability, cost and insurance coverage, as well as contraindications and
side effects (Kanj et al., 2019).</p>
<p>Progestin-only hormonal medication are
options, especially in trans masculine or nonbinary youth who are not interested in
estrogen-containing medical therapies as well as
those at risk for thromboembolic events or who
have other contraindications to estrogen therapy
(Carswell &amp; Roberts, 2017). Progestin-only hormonal medications include oral progestins,
depo-medroxyprogesterone injection, etonogestrel
implant, and levonorgestrel IUD (Schwartz et al.,
2019). Progestin-only hormonal options vary in
terms of efficacy in achieving menstrual suppression and have lower rates of achieving amenorrhea than combined oral contraception (Pradhan
&amp; Gomez-Lobo, 2019). A more detailed description of the relevant clinical studies is presented
in Chapter 12—Hormone Therapy. HCPs should
not make assumptions regarding the individual’s
preferred method of administration as some trans
masculine youth may prefer vaginal rings or IUD
implants (Akgul et al., 2019). Although hormonal
medications require monitoring for potential
mood lability, depressive effects, or both, the benefits and risks of untreated menstrual suppression
in the setting of gender dysphoria should be evaluated on an individual basis. Some patients may
opt for combined oral contraception that includes
different combinations of ethinyl estradiol, with
ranging doses, and different generations of progestins (Pradhan &amp; Gomez-Lobo, 2019). Lower
dose ethinyl estradiol components of combined
oral contraceptive pills are associated with
increased breakthrough uterine bleeding.
Continuous combined oral contraceptives may be
used to allow for continuous menstrual suppression and can be delivered as transdermal or vaginal rings.</p>
<p>The use of gonadotropin releasing hormone
(GnRH) analogues may also result in menstrual
suppression. However, it is recommended gender
diverse youth meet the eligibility criteria (as outlined in Statement 6.12) before this medication
is considered solely for this purpose (Carswell &amp;
Roberts, 2017; Pradhan &amp; Gomez-Lobo, 2019).
Finally, menstrual-suppression medications may
be indicated as an adjunctive therapy for breakthrough uterine bleeding that may occur while
on exogenous testosterone or as a bridging medication while awaiting menstrual suppression with
testosterone therapy. When exogenous testosterone is employed as a gender-affirming hormone,
menstrual suppression is typically achieved in the
first six months of therapy (Ahmad &amp; Leinung,
2017). However, it is vital adolescents be counseled ovulation and pregnancy can still occur in
the setting of amenorrhea (Gomez et al., 2020;
Kanj et al., 2019).</p>

<h2>Statement 6.8: We recommend health care professionals maintain an ongoing relationship with the gender diverse and transgender adolescent and any relevant caregivers to support the adolescent in their decision-making throughout the duration of puberty suppression treatment, hormonal treatment, and gender-related surgery until the transition is made to adult care.<a href="adolescents.html#statement-6.8-we-recommend-health-care-professionals-maintain-an-ongoing-relationship-with-the-gender-diverse-and-transgender-adolescent-and-any-relevant-caregivers-to-support-the-adolescent-in-their-decision-making-throughout-the-duration-of-puberty-suppression-treatment-hormonal-treatment-and-gender-related-surgery-until-the-transition-is-made-to-adult-care." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>HCPs with expertise in child and adolescent
development, as described in Statement 6.1, play
an important role in the continuity of care for
young people over the course of their
gender-related treatment needs. Supporting adolescents and their families necessitates approaching care using a developmental lens through
which understanding a young person’s evolving
emotional maturity and care needs can take place
over time. As gender-affirming treatment pathways differ based on the needs and experiences
of individual TGD adolescents, decision-making
for these treatments (puberty suppression, estrogens/androgens, gender-affirmation surgeries) can
occur at different points in time within a span
of several years. Longitudinal research demonstrating the benefits of pubertal suppression and
gender-affirming hormone treatment (GAHT)
was carried out in a setting where an ongoing
clinical relationship between the adolescents/families and the multidisciplinary team was maintained (de Vries et al., 2014).</p>
<p>Clinical settings that offer longer appointment
times provide space for adolescents and caregivers
to share important psychosocial aspects of emotional well-being (e.g., family dynamics, school,
romantic, and sexual experiences) that contextualize individualized gender-affirming treatment
needs and decisions as described elsewhere in
the chapter. An ongoing clinical relationship can
take place across settings, whether that be within
a multidisciplinary team or with providers in
different locations who collaborate with one
another. Given the wide variability in the ability
to obtain access to specialized gender care centers, particularly for marginalized groups who
experience disparities with access, it is important
for the HCP to appreciate the existence of any
barriers to care while maintaining flexibility when
defining how an ongoing clinical relationship can
take place in that specific context.</p>
<p>An ongoing clinical relationship that increases
resilience in the youth and provides support to
parents/caregivers who may have their own treatment needs may ultimately lead to increased
parental acceptance—when needed—which is
associated with better mental health outcomes in
youth (Ryan, Huebner et al., 2009).</p>

<p>TGD adolescents with gender dysphoria/gender incongruence who seek gender-affirming
medical and surgical treatments benefit from
the involvement of health care professionals
(HCPs) from different disciplines. Providing care
to TGD adolescents includes addressing 1) diagnostic considerations (see Statements 6.3, 6.12a,
and 6.12b) conducted by a specialized gender
HCP (as defined in Statement 6.1) whenever
possible and necessary; and 2) treatment considerations when prescribing, managing, and
monitoring medications for gender-affirming
medical and surgical care, requiring the training
of the relevant medical/surgical professional. The
list of key disciplines includes but is not limited
to adolescent medicine/primary care, endocrinology, psychology, psychiatry, speech/language
pathology, social work, support staff, and the
surgical team.</p>
<p>The evolving evidence has shown a clinical
benefit for transgender youth who receive their
gender-affirming treatments in multidisciplinary
gender clinics (de Vries et al., 2014; Kuper et al.,
2020; Tollit et al., 2019). Finally, adolescents seeking gender-affirming care in multidisciplinary
clinics are presenting with significant complexity
necessitating close collaboration between mental
health, medical, and/or surgical professionals
(McCallion et al., 2021; Sorbara et al., 2020;
Tishelman et al., 2015).</p>
<p>As not all patients and families are in the position or in a location to access multidisciplinary
care, the lack of available disciplines should not
preclude a young person from accessing needed
care in a timely manner. When disciplines are
available, particularly in centers with existing
multidisciplinary teams, disciplines, or both, it is
recommended efforts be made to include the relevant providers when developing a gender care
team. However, this does not mean all disciplines
are necessary to provide care to a particular
youth and family.</p>
<p>If written documentation or a letter is required
to recommend gender-affirming medical and surgical treatment (GAMST) for an adolescent, only
one letter of assessment from a member of the
multidisciplinary team is needed. This letter needs
to reflect the assessment and opinion from the team
that involves both medical HCPs and MHPs
(American Psychological Association, 2015; Hembree
et al., 2017; Telfer et al., 2018). Further assessment
results and written opinions may be requested when
there is a specific clinical need or when team members are in different locations or choose to write
their own summaries. For further information see
Chapter 5—Assessment for Adults, Statement 5.5.</p>

<h2>Statement 6.10: We recommend health care professionals working with transgender and gender diverse adolescents requesting gender-affirming medical or surgical treatments inform them, prior to the initiation of treatment, of the reproductive effects, including the potential loss of fertility and available options to preserve fertility within the context of the youth’s stage of pubertal development.<a href="adolescents.html#statement-6.10-we-recommend-health-care-professionals-working-with-transgender-and-gender-diverse-adolescents-requesting-gender-affirming-medical-or-surgical-treatments-inform-them-prior-to-the-initiation-of-treatment-of-the-reproductive-effects-including-the-potential-loss-of-fertility-and-available-options-to-preserve-fertility-within-the-context-of-the-youths-stage-of-pubertal-development." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>While assessing adolescents seeking
gender-affirming medical or surgical treatments,
HCPs should discuss the specific ways in which
the required treatment may affect reproductive
capacity. Fertility issues and the specific preservation options are more thoroughly discussed in
Chapter 12—Hormone Therapy and Chapter 16—
Reproductive Health.</p>
<p>It is important HCPs understand what fertility
preservation options exist so they can relay the
information to adolescents. Parents are advised
to be involved in this process and should also
understand the pros and cons of the different
options. HCPs should acknowledge adolescents
and parents may have different views around
reproductive capacity and may therefore come to
different decisions (Quain et al., 2020), which is
why HCPs can be helpful in guiding this process.</p>
<p>HCPs should specifically pay attention to the
developmental and psychological aspects of fertility preservation and decision-making competency for the individual adolescent. While
adolescents may think they have made up their
minds concerning their reproductive capacity, the
possibility their opinions about having
biologically related children in the future might
change over time needs to be discussed with an
HCP who has sufficient experience, is knowledgeable about adolescent development, and has
experience working with parents.</p>
<p>Addressing the long-term consequences on fertility of gender-affirming medical treatments and
ensuring transgender adolescents have realistic
expectations concerning fertility preservation
options or adoption cannot not be addressed with
a one-time discussion but should be part of an
ongoing conversation. This conversation should
occur not only before initiating any medical
intervention (puberty suppression, hormones, or
surgeries), but also during further treatment and
during transition.</p>
<p>Currently, there are only preliminary results
from retrospective studies evaluating transgender
adults and the decisions they made when they
were young regarding the consequences of
medical-affirming treatment on reproductive
capacity. It is important not to make assumptions
about what future adult goals an adolescent may
have. Research in childhood cancer survivors
found participants who acknowledged missed
opportunities for fertility preservation reported
distress and regret surrounding potential infertility
(Armuand et al., 2014; Ellis et al., 2016; Lehmann
et al., 2017). Furthermore, individuals with cancer
who did not prioritize having biological children
before treatment have reported “changing their
minds” in survivorship (Armuand et al., 2014).</p>
<p>Given the complexities of the different fertility
preservation options and the challenges HCPs
may experience discussing fertility with the adolescent and the family (Tishelman et al., 2019),
a fertility consultation is an important consideration for every transgender adolescent who pursues medical-affirming treatments unless the local
situation is such that a fertility consultation is
not covered by insurance or public health care
plans, is not available locally, or the individual
circumstances make this unpreferable.</p>

<h2>Statement 6.11: We recommend when gender-affirming medical or surgical treatments are indicated for adolescents, health care professionals working with transgender and gender diverse adolescents involve parent(s)/guardian(s) in the assessment and treatment process, unless their involvement is determined to be harmful to the adolescent or not feasible.<a href="adolescents.html#statement-6.11-we-recommend-when-gender-affirming-medical-or-surgical-treatments-are-indicated-for-adolescents-health-care-professionals-working-with-transgender-and-gender-diverse-adolescents-involve-parentsguardians-in-the-assessment-and-treatment-process-unless-their-involvement-is-determined-to-be-harmful-to-the-adolescent-or-not-feasible." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>When there is an indication an adolescent
might benefit from a gender-affirming medical
or surgical treatment, involving the parent(s) or
primary caregiver(s) in the assessment process is
recommended in almost all situations
(Edwards-Leeper &amp; Spack, 2012; Rafferty et al.,
2018). Exceptions to this might include situations
in which an adolescent is in foster care, child
protective services, or both, and custody and parent involvement would be impossible, inappropriate, or harmful. Parent and family support of
TGD youth is a primary predictor of youth
well-being and is protective of the mental health
of TGD youth (Gower, Rider, Coleman et al.,
2018; Grossman et al., 2019; Lefevor et al., 2019;
McConnell et al., 2015; Pariseau et al., 2019;
Ryan, 2009; Ryan et al., 2010; Simons et al., 2013;
Wilson et al., 2016). Therefore, including
parent(s)/caregiver(s) in the assessment process
to encourage and facilitate increased parental
understanding and support of the adolescent may
be one of the most helpful practices available.</p>
<p>Parent(s)/caregiver(s) may provide key information for the clinical team, such as the young person’s gender and overall developmental, medical,
and mental health history as well as insights into
the young person’s level of current support, general
functioning, and well-being. Concordance or divergence of reports given by the adolescent and their
parent(s)/caregiver(s) may be important information for the assessment team and can aid in
designing and shaping individualized youth and
family supports (De Los Reyes et al., 2019;
Katz-Wise et al., 2017). Knowledge of the family
context, including resilience factors and challenges,
can help providers know where special supports
would be needed during the medical treatment
process. Engagement of parent(s)/caregiver(s) is
also important for educating families about various
treatment approaches, ongoing follow-up and care
needs, and potential treatment complications.
Through psychoeducation regarding clinical gender
care options and participation in the assessment
process, which may unfold over time, parent(s)/
caregiver(s) may better understand their adolescent
child’s gender-related experience and needs
(Andrzejewski et al., 2020; Katz-Wise et al., 2017).</p>
<p>Parent/caregiver concerns or questions regarding the stability of gender-related needs over time
and implications of various gender-affirming
interventions are common and should not be
dismissed. It is appropriate for parent(s)/caregiver(s) to ask these questions, and there are
cases in which the parent(s)/caregiver(s)’ questions or concerns are particularly helpful in
informing treatment decisions and plans. For
example, a parent/caregiver report may provide
critical context in situations in which a young
person experiences very recent or sudden
self-awareness of gender diversity and a corresponding gender treatment request, or when there
is concern for possible excessive peer and social
media influence on a young person’s current
self-gender concept. Contextualization of the parent/caregiver report is also critical, as the report
of a young person’s gender history as provided
by parent(s)/caregiver(s) may or may not align
with the young person’s self-report. Importantly,
gender histories may be unknown to parent(s)/
caregiver(s) because gender may be internal experience for youth, not known by others unless it
is discussed. For this reason, an adolescent’s
report of their gender history and experience is
central to the assessment process.</p>
<p>Some parents may present with unsupportive
or antagonistic beliefs about TGD identities, clinical gender care, or both (Clark et al., 2020).
Such unsupportive perspectives are an important
therapeutic target for families. Although challenging parent perspectives may in some cases seem
rigid, providers should not assume this is the
case. There are many examples of parent(s)/caregiver(s) who, over time with support and psychoeducation, have become increasingly accepting
of their TGD child’s gender diversity and
care needs.</p>
<p>Helping youth and parent(s)/caregiver(s) work
together on important gender care decisions is a
primary goal. However, in some cases, parent(s)/
caregiver(s) may be too rejecting of their adolescent child and their child’s gender needs to be
part of the clinical evaluation process. In these
situations, youth may require the engagement of
larger systems of advocacy and support to move
forward with the necessary support and care
(Dubin et al., 2020).</p>

<p>When working with TGD adolescents, HCPs
should realize while a classification may give
access to care, pathologizing transgender identities may be experienced as stigmatizing (Beek
et al., 2016). Assessments related to gender health
and gender diversity have been criticized, and
controversies exist around diagnostic systems
(Drescher, 2016).</p>
<p>HCPs should assess the overall gender-related
history and gender care-related needs of youth.
Through this assessment process, HCPs may provide a diagnosis when it is required to get access
to transgender-related care.</p>
<p>Gender incongruence and gender dysphoria
are the two diagnostic terms used in the World
Health Organization’s International Classification
of Diseases (ICD) and the American Psychiatric
Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders (DSM), respectively. Of
these two widely used classification systems, the
DSM is for psychiatric classifications only and
the ICD contains all diseases and conditions
related to physical as well as mental health. The
most recent versions of these two systems, the
DSM-5 and the ICD-11, reflect a long history
of reconceptualizing and de-psychopathologizing
gender-related diagnoses (American Psychiatric
Association, 2013; World Health Organization,
2019a). Compared with the earlier version, the
DSM-5 replaced gender identity disorder with
gender dysphoria, acknowledging the distress
experienced by some people stemming from the
incongruence between experienced gender identity and the sex assigned at birth. In the most
recent revision, the DSM-5-TR, no changes in
the diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria are
made. However, terminology was adapted into
the most appropriate current language (e.g.,
birth-assigned gender instead of natal-gender
and gender-affirming treatment instead of gender reassignment (American Psychiatric
Association, 2022). Compared with the ICD 10th
edition, the gender incongruence classification
was moved from the Mental Health chapter to
the Conditions Related to Sexual Health chapter
in the ICD-11. When compared with the DSM-5
classification of gender dysphoria, one important
reconceptualization is distress is not a required
indicator of the ICD-11 classification of gender
incongruence (WHO, 2019a). After all, when
growing up in a supporting and accepting environment, the distress and impairment criterion,
an inherent part of every mental health condition, may not be applicable (Drescher, 2012). As
such, the ICD-11 classification of gender incongruence may better capture the fullness of gender diversity experiences and related clinical
gender needs.</p>
<p>Criteria for the ICD-11 classification gender
incongruence of adolescence or adulthood require
a marked and persistent incongruence between an
individual´s experienced gender and the assigned
sex, which often leads to a need to “transition” to
live and be accepted as a person of the experienced gender. For some, this includes hormonal
treatment, surgery, or other health care services
to enable the individual´s body to align as much
as required, and to the extent possible, with the
person’s experienced gender. Relevant for adolescents is the indicator that a classification cannot
be assigned “prior to the onset of puberty.” Finally,
it is noted “that gender variant behaviour and
preferences alone are not a basis for assigning the
classification” (WHO, ICD-11, 2019a).</p>
<p>Criteria for the DSM-5 and DSM-5-TR classification of gender dysphoria in adolescence and
adulthood denote “a marked incongruence between
one’s experienced/expressed gender and assigned
gender, of at least 6 months’ duration’ (criterion
A, fulfilled when 2 of 6 subcriteria are manifest;
DSM-5, APA, 2013; DSM 5-TR, APA, 2022).</p>
<p>Of note, although a gender-related classification is one of the requirements for receiving
medical gender-affirming care, such a classification alone does not indicate a person needs
medical-affirming care. The range of youth experiences of gender incongruence necessitates professionals provide a range of treatments or
interventions based on the individual’s needs.
Counseling, gender exploration, mental health
assessment and, when needed, treatment with
MHPs trained in gender development may all be
indicated with or without the implementation of
medical-affirming care.</p>

<h3>Statement 6.12.b: The experience of gender diversity/incongruence is marked and sustained over time.<a href="adolescents.html#statement-6.12.b-the-experience-of-gender-diversityincongruence-is-marked-and-sustained-over-time." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Identity exploration and consolidation are
experienced by many adolescents (Klimstra et al.,
2010; Topolewska-Siedzik &amp; Cieciuch, 2018).
Identity exploration during adolescence may
include a process of self-discovery around gender
and gender identity (Steensma, Kreukels et al.,
2013). Little is known about how processes that
underlie consolidation of gender identity during
adolescence (e.g., the process of commitment to
specific identities) may impact a young person’s
experience(s) or needs over time.</p>
<p>Therefore, the level of reversibility of a
gender-affirming medical intervention should be
considered along with the sustained duration of
a young person’s experience of gender incongruence when initiating treatment. Given potential shifts in gender-related experiences and
needs during adolescence, it is important to
establish the young person has experienced several years of persistent gender diversity/incongruence prior to initiating less reversible
treatments such as gender-affirming hormones
or surgeries. Puberty suppression treatment,
which provides more time for younger adolescents to engage their decision-making capacities,
also raises important considerations (see
Statement 6.12f and Chapter 12—Hormone
Therapy) suggesting the importance of a sustained experience of gender incongruence/diversity prior to initiation. However, in this age
group of younger adolescents, several years is
not always practical nor necessary given the
premise of the treatment as a means to buy time
while avoiding distress from irreversible pubertal
changes. For youth who have experienced a
shorter duration of gender incongruence, social
transition-related and/or other medical supports
(e.g., menstrual suppression/androgen blocking)
may also provide some relief as well as furnishing additional information to the clinical team
regarding a young person’s broad gender care
needs (see Statements 6.4, 6.6, and 6.7).</p>
<p>Establishing evidence of persistent gender
diversity/incongruence typically requires careful
assessment with the young person over time (see
Statement 6.3). Whenever possible and when
appropriate, the assessment and discernment process should also include the parent(s)/caregiver(s)
(see Statement 6.11). Evidence demonstrating
gender diversity/incongruence sustained over time
can be provided via history obtained directly
from the adolescent and parents/caregivers when
this information is not documented in the medical records.</p>
<p>The research literature on continuity versus
discontinuity of gender-affirming medical care
needs/requests is complex and somewhat difficult to interpret. A series of studies conducted
over the last several decades, including some
with methodological challenges (as noted by
Temple Newhook et al., 2018; Winters et al.,
2018) suggest the experience of gender incongruence is not consistent for all children as they
progress into adolescence. For example, a subset
of youth who experienced gender incongruence
or who socially transitioned prior to puberty
over time can show a reduction in or even full
discontinuation of gender incongruence (de
Vries et al., 2010; Olson et al., 2022; Ristori &amp;
Steensma, 2016; Singh et al., 2021; Wagner et al.,
2021). However, there has been less research
focused on rates of continuity and discontinuity
of gender incongruence and gender-related needs
in pubertal and adolescent populations. The data
available regarding broad unselected
gender-referred pubertal/adolescent cohorts
(from the Amsterdam transgender clinic) suggest
that, following extended assessments over time,
a subset of adolescents with gender incongruence presenting for gender care elect not to
pursue gender-affirming medical care</p>
<p>(Arnoldussen et al., 2019; de Vries, Steensma
et al., 2011). Importantly, findings from studies
of gender incongruent pubertal/adolescent
cohorts, in which participants who have undergone comprehensive gender evaluation over
time, have shown persistent gender incongruence
and gender-related need and have received referrals for medical gender care, suggest low levels
of regret regarding gender-related medical care
decisions (de Vries et al., 2014; Wiepjes et al.,
2018). Critically, these findings of low regret
can only currently be applied to youth who have
demonstrated sustained gender incongruence
and gender-related needs over time as established through a comprehensive and iterative
assessment (see Statement 6.3).</p>

<h3>Statement 6.12.c: The adolescent demonstrates the emotional and cognitive maturity required to provide informed consent/assent for the treatment.<a href="adolescents.html#statement-6.12.c-the-adolescent-demonstrates-the-emotional-and-cognitive-maturity-required-to-provide-informed-consentassent-for-the-treatment." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The process of informed consent includes communication between a patient and their provider
regarding the patient’s understanding of a potential intervention as well as, ultimately, the patient’s
decision whether to receive the intervention. In
most settings, for minors, the legal guardian is
integral to the informed consent process: if a
treatment is to be given, the legal guardian (often
the parent[s]/caregiver[s]) provides the informed
consent to do so. In most settings, assent is a
somewhat parallel process in which the minor
and the provider communicate about the intervention and the provider assesses the level of
understanding and intention.</p>
<p>A necessary step in the informed consent/
assent process for considering gender-affirming
medical care is a careful discussion with qualified
HCPs trained to assess the emotional and cognitive maturity of adolescents. The reversible and
irreversible effects of the treatment, as well as
fertility preservation options (when applicable),
and all potential risks and benefits of the intervention are important components of the discussion. These discussions are required when
obtaining informed consent/assent. Assessment
of cognitive and emotional maturity is important
because it helps the care team understand the
adolescent’s capacity to be informed.</p>
<p>The skills necessary to assent/consent to any
medical intervention or treatment include the
ability to 1) comprehend the nature of the treatment; 2) reason about treatment options, including the risks and benefits; 3) appreciate the nature
of the decision, including the long-term consequences; and 4) communicate choice
(Grootens-Wiegers et al., 2017). In the case of
gender- affirming medical treatments, a young
person should be well-informed about what the
treatment may and may not accomplish, typical
timelines for changes to appear (e.g., with
gender-affirming hormones), and any implications
of stopping the treatment. Gender-diverse youth
should fully understand the reversible, partially
reversible, and irreversible aspects of a treatment,
as well as the limits of what is known about certain treatments (e.g., the impact of pubertal suppression on brain development (Chen and Loshak,
2020)). Gender-diverse youth should also understand, although many gender-diverse youth begin
gender- affirming medical care and experience
that care as a good fit for them long-term, there
is a subset of individuals who over time discover
this care is not a fit for them (Wiepjes et al.,
2018). Youth should know such shifts are sometimes connected to a change in gender needs over
time, and in some cases, a shift in gender identity
itself. Given this information, gender diverse
youth must be able to reason thoughtfully about
treatment options, considering the implications of
the choices at hand. Furthermore, as a foundation
for providing assent, the gender-diverse young
person needs to be able to communicate
their choice.</p>
<p>The skills needed to accomplish the tasks
required for assent/consent may not emerge at
specific ages per se (Grootens-Wiegers et al.,
2017). There may be variability in these capacities
related to developmental differences and mental
health presentations (Shumer &amp; Tishelman, 2015)
and dependent on the opportunities a young person has had to practice these skills (Alderson,
2007). Further, assessment of emotional and cognitive maturity must be conducted separately for
each gender-related treatment decision
(Vrouenraets et al., 2021).</p>
<p>The following questions may be useful to consider in assessing a young person’s emotional and
cognitive readiness to assent or consent to a specific gender-affirming treatment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can the young person think carefully into the future and consider the implications of a partially or fully irreversible intervention?</li>
<li>Does the young person have sufficient self-reflective capacity to consider the possibility that gender-related needs and priorities can develop over time, and gender-related priorities at a certain point in time might change?</li>
<li>Has the young person, to some extent, thought through the implications of what they might do if their priorities around gender do change in the future?</li>
<li>Is the young person able to understand and manage the day-to-day short- and long-term aspects of a specific medical treatment (e.g., medication adherence, administration, and necessary medical follow-ups)?</li>
</ul>
<p>Assessment of emotional and cognitive maturity may be accomplished over time as the care
team continues to engage in conversations about
the treatment options and affords the young person the opportunity to practice thinking into
the future and flexibly consider options and
implications. For youth with neurodevelopmental
and/or some types of mental health differences,
skills for future thinking, planning, big picture
thinking, and self-reflection may be less-well
developed (Dubbelink &amp; Geurts, 2017). In these
cases, a more careful approach to consent and
assent may be required, and this may include
additional time and structured opportunities for
the young person to practice the skills necessary
for medical decision-making (Strang, Powers
et al., 2018).</p>
<p>For unique situations in which an adolescent
minor is consenting for their own treatment without parental permission (see Statement 6.11),
extra care must be taken to support the adolescent’s informed decision-making. This will typically require greater levels of engagement of and
collaboration between the HCPs working with
the adolescent to provide the young person
appropriate cognitive and emotional support to
consider options, weigh benefits and potential
challenges/costs, and develop a plan for any
needed (and potentially ongoing) supports associated with the treatment.</p>

<p>Evidence indicates TGD adolescents are at
increased risk of mental health challenges, often
related to family/caregiver rejection, non-affirming
community environments, and neurodiversityrelated factors (e.g., de Vries et al., 2016; Pariseau
et al., 2019; Ryan et al., 2010; Weinhardt et al.,
2017). A young person’s mental health challenges
may impact their conceptualization of their gender development histor y and gender
identity-related needs, the adolescent’s capacity
to consent, and the ability of the young person
to engage in or receive medical treatment.
Additionally, like cisgender youth, TGD youth
may experience mental health concerns irrespective of the presence of gender dysphoria or gender incongruence. In particular, depression and
self-harm may be of specific concern; many studies reveal depression scores and emotional and
behavioral problems comparable to those reported
in populations referred to mental health clinics
(Leibowitz &amp; de Vries, 2016). Higher rates of
suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and self-harm
have also been reported (de Graaf et al., 2020).
In addition, eating disorders occur more frequently than expected in non-referred populations (Khatchadourian et al., 2013; Ristori et al.,
2019; Spack et al., 2012). Importantly, TGD adolescents show high rates of autism spectrum disorder/characteristics (Øien et al., 2018; van der
Miesen et al., 2016; see also Statement 6.1d).
Other neurodevelopmental presentations and/or
mental health challenges may also be present,
(e.g., ADHD, intellectual disability, and psychotic
disorders (de Vries, Doreleijers et al., 2011; Meijer
et al., 2018; Parkes &amp; Hall, 2006).</p>
<p>Of note, many transgender adolescents are
well-functioning and experience few if any mental
health concerns. For example, socially transitioned pubertal adolescents who receive medical
gender- affirming treatment at specialized gender
clinics may experience mental health outcomes
equivalent to those of their cisgender peers (e.g.,
de Vries et al., 2014; van der Miesen et al., 2020).
A provider’s key task is to assess the direction
of the relationships that exist between any mental
health challenges and the young person’s
self-understanding of gender care needs and then
prioritize accordingly.</p>
<p>Mental health difficulties may challenge the
assessment and treatment of gender-related needs
of TGD adolescents in various ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>First, when a TGD adolescent is experiencing acute suicidality, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health crises that threaten physical health, safety must be prioritized. According to the local context and existing guidelines, appropriate care should seek to mitigate the threat or crisis so there is sufficient time and stabilization for thoughtful gender-related assessment and decision-making. For example, an actively suicidal adolescent may not be emotionally able to make an informed decision regarding gender-affirming medical/surgical treatment. If indicated, safety-related interventions should not preclude starting gender-affirming care.</li>
<li>Second, mental health can also complicate the assessment of gender development and gender identity-related needs. For example, it is critical to differentiate gender incongruence from specific mental health presentations, such as obsessions and compulsions, special interests in autism, rigid thinking, broader identity problems, parent/child interaction difficulties, severe
developmental anxieties (e.g., fear of growing up and pubertal changes unrelated to gender identity), trauma, or psychotic thoughts. Mental health challenges that interfere with the clarity of identity development and gender-related decision-making should be prioritized and addressed.</li>
<li>Third, decision-making regarding gender-affirming medical treatments that have life-long consequences requires thoughtful, future-oriented thinking by the adolescent, with support from the parents/ caregivers, as indicated (see Statement 6.11). To be able to make such an informed decision, an adolescent should be able to understand the issues, express a choice, appreciate and give careful thought regarding the wish for medical-affirming treatment (see Statement 6.12c). Neurodevelopmental differences, such as autistic features or autism spectrum disorder (see Statement 6.1d, e.g., communication differences; a preference for concrete or rigid thinking; differences in self-awareness, future thinking and planning), may challenge the assessment and decision-making process; neurodivergent youth may require extra support, structure, psychoeducation, and time built into the assessment process (Strang, Powers et al., 2018). Other mental health presentations that involve reduced communication and self-advocacy, difficulty engaging in assessment, memory and concentration difficulties, hopelessness, and difficulty engaging in future-oriented thinking may complicate assessment and decision-making. In such cases, extended time is often necessary before any decisions regarding medical-affirming treatment can be made.</li>
<li>Finally, while addressing mental health concerns is important during the course of medical treatment, it does not mean all mental health challenges can or should be resolved completely. However, it is important any mental health concerns are addressed sufficiently so that gender -affirming medical treatment can be provided optimally (e.g., medication adherence, attending follow-up medical appointments, and self-care, particularly during a postoperative course).</li>

<h3>Statement 6.12.f: The adolescent has reached Tanner stage 2 of puberty for pubertal suppression to be initiated.<a href="adolescents.html#statement-6.12.f-the-adolescent-has-reached-tanner-stage-2-of-puberty-for-pubertal-suppression-to-be-initiated." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The onset of puberty is a pivotal point for
many gender diverse youth. For some, it creates
an intensification of their gender incongruence,
and for others, pubertal onset may lead to gender
fluidity (e.g., a transition from binary to nonbinary gender identity) or even attenuation of a
previously affirmed gender identity (Drummond
et al., 2008; Steensma et al., 2011, Steensma,
Kreukels et al., 2013; Wallien &amp; Cohen-Kettenis,
2008). The use of puberty-blocking medications,
such as GnRH analogues, is not recommended
until children have achieved a minimum of
Tanner stage 2 of puberty because the experience
of physical puberty may be critical for further
gender identity development for some TGD adolescents (Steensma et al., 2011). Therefore,
puberty blockers should not be implemented in
prepubertal gender diverse youth (Waal &amp;
Cohen-Kettenis, 2006). For some youth, GnRH
agonists may be appropriate in late stages or in
the post-pubertal period (e.g., Tanner stage 4 or
5), and this should be highly individualized. See
Chapter 12—Hormone Therapy for a more comprehensive review of the use of GnRH agonists.</p>
<p>Variations in the timing of pubertal onset is
due to multiple factors (e.g., sex assigned at birth,
genetics, nutrition, etc.). Tanner staging refers to
five stages of pubertal development ranging from
prepubertal (Tanner stage 1) to post-pubertal,
and adult sexual maturity (Tanner stage 5)
(Marshall &amp; Tanner, 1969, 1970). For assigned
females at birth, pubertal onset (e.g., gonadarche)
is defined by the occurrence of breast budding
(Tanner stage 2), and for birth-assigned males,
the achievement of a testicular volume of greater
than or equal to 4 mL (Roberts &amp; Kaiser, 2020).
An experienced medical provider should be relied
on to differentiate the onset of puberty from
physical changes such as pubic hair and apocrine
body odor due to sex steroids produced by the
adrenal gland (e.g., adrenarche) as adrenarche
does not warrant the use of puberty-blocking
medications (Roberts &amp; Kaiser, 2020). Educating
parents and families about the difference between
adrenarche and gonadarche helps families understand the timing during which shared
decision-making about gender-affirming medical
therapies should be undertaken with their multidisciplinary team.</p>
<p>The importance of addressing other risks and
benefits of pubertal suppression, both hypothetical and actual, cannot be overstated. Evidence
supports the existence of surgical implications for
transgender girls who proceed with pubertal suppression (van de Grift et al., 2020). Longitudinal
data exists to demonstrate improvement in
romantic and sexual satisfaction for adolescents
receiving puberty suppression, hormone treatment
and surgery (Bungener et al., 2020). A study on
surgical outcomes of laparoscopic intestinal vaginoplasty (performed because of limited genital
tissue after the use of puberty blockers) in transgender women revealed that the majority experienced orgasm after surgery (84%), although a
specific correlation between sexual pleasure outcomes and the timing of pubertal suppression
initiation was not discussed in the study (Bouman,
van der Sluis et al., 2016), nor does the study
apply to those who would prefer a different surgical procedure. This underscores the importance
of engaging in discussions with families about
the future unknowns related to surgical and sexual health outcomes.</p>

<h3>Statement 6.12.g: The adolescent had at least 12 months of gender-affirming hormone therapy or longer, if required, to achieve the desired surgical result for gender-affirming procedures, including breast augmentation, orchiectomy, vaginoplasty, hysterectomy, phalloplasty, metoidioplasty, and facial surgery as part of gender-affirming treatment unless hormone therapy is either not desired or is medically contraindicated.<a href="adolescents.html#statement-6.12.g-the-adolescent-had-at-least-12-months-of-gender-affirming-hormone-therapy-or-longer-if-required-to-achieve-the-desired-surgical-result-for-gender-affirming-procedures-including-breast-augmentation-orchiectomy-vaginoplasty-hysterectomy-phalloplasty-metoidioplasty-and-facial-surgery-as-part-of-gender-affirming-treatment-unless-hormone-therapy-is-either-not-desired-or-is-medically-contraindicated." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>GAHT leads to anatomical, physiological, and
psychological changes. The onset of the anatomic
effects (e.g., clitoral growth, breast growth, vaginal mucosal atrophy) may begin early after the
initiation of therapy, and the peak effect is
expected at 1–2 years (T’Sjoen et al., 2019). To
ensure sufficient time for psychological adaptations to the physical change during an important
developmental time for the adolescent, 12 months
of hormone treatment is suggested. Depending
upon the surgical result required, a period of
hormone treatment may need to be longer (e.g.,
sufficient clitoral virilization prior to metoidioplasty/phalloplasty, breast growth and skin expansion prior to breast augmentation, softening of
skin and changes in facial fat distribution prior
to facial GAS) (de Blok et al., 2021).</p>
<p>For individuals who are not taking hormones
prior to surgical interventions, it is important
surgeons review the impact of hormone therapy
on the proposed surgery. In addition, for individuals undergoing gonadectomy who are not
taking hormones, a plan for hormone replacement can be developed with their prescribing
professional prior to surgery.</p>

<h2>Consideration of ages for gender-affirming medical and surgical treatment for adolescents<a href="adolescents.html#consideration-of-ages-for-gender-affirming-medical-and-surgical-treatment-for-adolescents" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Age has a strong, albeit imperfect, correlation
with cognitive and psychosocial development and
may be a useful objective marker for determining
the potential timing of interventions (Ferguson
et al., 2021). Higher (i.e., more advanced) ages
may be required for treatments with greater irreversibility, complexity, or both. This approach
allows for continued cognitive/emotional maturation that may be required for the adolescent
to fully consider and consent to increasingly complex treatments (see Statement 6.12c).</p>
<p>A growing body of evidence indicates providing gender-affirming treatment for gender diverse
youth who meet criteria leads to positive outcomes (Achille et al., 2020; de Vries et al., 2014;
Kuper et al., 2020). There is, however, limited
data on the optimal timing of gender-affirming
interventions as well as the long-term physical,
psychological, and neurodevelopmental outcomes
in youth (Chen et al., 2020; Chew et al., 2018;
Olson-Kennedy et al., 2016). Currently, the only
existing longitudinal studies evaluating gender
diverse youth and adult outcomes are based on
a specific model (i.e., the Dutch approach) that
involved a comprehensive initial assessment with
follow-up. In this approach, pubertal suppression
was considered at age 12, GAHT at age 16, and
surgical interventions after age 18 with exceptions
in some cases. It is not clear if deviations from
this approach would lead to the same or different
outcomes. Longitudinal studies are currently
underway to better define outcomes as well as
the safety and efficacy of gender-affirming treatments in youth (Olson-Kennedy, Garofalo et al.,
2019; Olson-Kennedy, Rosenthal et al., 2019).
While the long-term effects of gender-affirming
treatments initiated in adolescence are not fully
known, the potential negative health consequences
of delaying treatment should also be considered
(de Vries et al., 2021). As the evidence base
regarding outcomes of gender-affirming interventions in youth continues to grow, recommendations on the timing and readiness for these
interventions may be updated.</p>
<p>Previous guidelines regarding gender-affirming
treatment of adolescents recommended partially
reversible GAHT could be initiated at approximately 16 years of age (Coleman et al., 2012;
Hembree et al., 2009). More recent guidelines
suggest there may be compelling reasons to initiate GAHT prior to the age of 16, although
there are limited studies on youth who have
initiated hormones prior to 14 years of age
(Hembree et al., 2017). A compelling reason for
earlier initiation of GAHT, for example, might
be to avoid prolonged pubertal suppression,
given potential bone health concerns and the
psychosocial implications of delaying puberty as
described in more detail in Chapter 12—
Hormone Therapy (Klink, Caris et al., 2015;
Schagen et al., 2020; Vlot et al., 2017; Zhu &amp;
Chan, 2017). Puberty is a time of significant
brain and cognitive development. The potential
neurodevelopmental impact of extended pubertal
suppression in gender diverse youth has been
specifically identified as an area in need of continued study (Chen et al., 2020). While GnRH
analogs have been shown to be safe when used
for the treatment of precocious puberty, there
are concerns delaying exposure to sex hormones
(endogenous or exogenous) at a time of peak
bone mineralization may lead to decreased bone
mineral density. The potential decrease in bone
mineral density as well as the clinical significance of any decrease requires continued study
(Klink, Caris et al., 2015; Lee, Finlayson et al.,
2020; Schagen et al., 2020). The potential negative psychosocial implications of not initiating
puberty with peers may place additional stress
on gender diverse youth, although this has not
been explicitly studied. When considering the
timing of initiation of gender-affirming hormones, providers should compare the potential
physical and psychological benefits and risks of
starting treatment with the potential risks and
benefits of delaying treatment. This process can
also help identify compelling factors that may
warrant an individualized approach.</p>
<p>Studies carried out with trans masculine youth
have demonstrated chest dysphoria is associated
with higher rates of anxiety, depression, and distress and can lead to functional limitations, such
as avoiding exercising or bathing (Mehringer
et al., 2021; Olson-Kennedy, Warus et al., 2018;
Sood et al., 2021). Testosterone unfortunately
does little to alleviate this distress, although chest
masculinization is an option for some individuals
to address this distress long-term. Studies with
youth who sought chest masculinization surgery
to alleviate chest dysphoria demonstrated good
surgical outcomes, satisfaction with results, and
minimal regret during the study monitoring
period (Marinkovic &amp; Newfield, 2017;
Olson-Kennedy, Warus et al., 2018). Chest masculinization surgery can be considered in minors
when clinically and developmentally appropriate
as determined by a multidisciplinary team experienced in adolescent and gender development
(see relevant statements in this chapter). The
duration or current use of testosterone therapy
should not preclude surgery if otherwise indicated. The needs of some TGD youth may be
met by chest masculinization surgery alone.
Breast augmentation may be needed by trans
feminine youth, although there is less data about
this procedure in youth, possibly due to fewer
individuals requesting this procedure (Boskey
et al., 2019; James, 2016). GAHT, specifically
estrogen, can help with development of breast
tissue, and it is recommended youth have a minimum of 12 months of hormone therapy, or longer as is surgically indicated, prior to breast
augmentation unless hormone therapy is not
clinically indicated or is medically
contraindicated.</p>
<p>Data are limited on the optimal timing for initiating other gender-affirming surgical treatments
in adolescents. This is partly due to the limited
access to these treatments, which varies in different geographical locations (Mahfouda et al., 2019).
Data indicate rates of gender-affirming surgeries
have increased since 2000, and there has been an
increase in the number of TGD youth seeking
vaginoplasty (Mahfouda et al., 2019; Milrod &amp;
Karasic, 2017). A 2017 study of 20 WPATH-affiliated
surgeons in the US reported slightly more than
half had performed vaginoplasty in minors (Milrod
&amp; Karasic, 2017). Limited data are available on
the outcomes for youth undergoing vaginoplasty.
Small studies have reported improved psychosocial
functioning and decreased gender dysphoria in
adolescents who have undergone vaginoplasty
(Becker et al., 2018; Cohen-Kettenis &amp; van Goozen,
1997; Smith et al.,2001). While the sample sizes
are small, these studies suggest there may be a
benefit for some adolescents to having these procedures performed before the age of 18. Factors
that may support pursuing these procedures for
youth under 18 years of age include the increased
availability of support from family members,
greater ease of managing postoperative care prior
to transitioning to tasks of early adulthood (e.g.,
entering university or the workforce), and safety
concerns in public spaces (i.e., to reduce transphobic violence) (Boskey et al., 2018; Boskey et al.,
2019; Mahfouda et al., 2019). Given the complexity
and irreversibility of these procedures, an assessment of the adolescent’s ability to adhere to postsurgical care recommendations and to comprehend
the long-term impacts of these procedures on
reproductive and sexual function is crucial (Boskey
et al., 2019). Given the complexity of phalloplasty,
and current high rates of complications in comparison to other gender-affirming surgical treatments, it is not recommended this surgery be
considered in youth under 18 at this time (see
Chapter 13—Surgery and Postoperative Care).</p>
<p>Additional key factors that should be taken
into consideration when discussing the timing of
interventions with youth and families are
addressed in detail in statements 6.12a-f. For a
summary of the criteria/recommendations for
medically necessary gender-affirming medical
treatment in adolescents, see Appendix D.</p>

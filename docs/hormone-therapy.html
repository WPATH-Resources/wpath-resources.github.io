<p>Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) persons
may require medically necessary gender-affirming
hormone therapy (GAHT) to achieve changes
consistent with their embodiment goals, gender
identity, or both (see medically necessary statement in Chapter 2—Global Applicability,
Statement 2.1). This chapter describes hormone
therapy recommendations for TGD adults and
adolescents. Please refer to Chapter 5—
Assessment of Adults and Chapter 6—Adolescents
for the assessment criteria related to initiation
of hormone therapy for adults and adolescents,
respectively. A summary of the recommendations and assessment criteria can be found in
Appendix D.</p>
<p>Ever since the first World Professional
Association for Transgender Health (WPATH)
Standards of Care (SOC) was published in 1979
and in subsequent updates of the SOC, including
SOC version 7, GAHT has been accepted as medically necessary (Coleman et al., 2012). WPATH
endorsed the Endocrine Society’s guidelines for
GAHT for TGD persons in 2009 and 2017
(Hembree et al., 2009; Hembree et al., 2017). The
European Society for Sexual Medicine has also
published a position statement on hormone management in adolescent and adult TGD people
(T’Sjoen et al., 2020). When provided under medical supervision, GAHT in adults is safe
(Tangpricha &amp; den Heijer, 2017; Safer &amp;
Tangpricha, 2019). However, there are some
potential long-term risks, and careful monitoring
and screening are required to reduce adverse
events (Hembree et al., 2017; Rosenthal, 2021).</p>
<p>In general, the goal is to target serum levels
of the sex steroids to match the levels associated
with the individual’s gender identity, although
optimal target ranges have not been established
(Hembree et al., 2017). Health care professionals
(HCPs) can use serum testosterone and/or estradiol levels to monitor most sex steroid treatments.
However, conjugated estrogens or synthetic estrogen use cannot be monitored. The assumption
that the estrone/estradiol ratio should be monitored was not supported in a recent cohort study
as there was no relationship between estrone
concentration and change in body fat or breast
development seen in a European cohort of 212
adult transgender women during a 1-year
follow-up of hormone treatment (Tebbens et al.,
2021). This study demonstrated higher estrone
concentrations or higher estrone/estradiol ratios
are not associated with antagonistic effects on
feminization (fat percentage and breast development) (Tebbens et al., 2021). Thus, monitoring
of the estrone to estradiol ratio is not supported
by the current published evidence. Previously
used conjugated estrogens have been abandoned
in favor of bioidentical estrogens. Even if several
studies have shown a significantly greater risk of
thromboembolic and cardiovascular complications
with the use of oral conjugated estrogens compared with oral estradiol in postmenopausal
women, no randomized controlled trials have
taken place, either in postmenopausal women or
in transgender people undergoing estrogen treatment (Smith et al., 2014).</p>
<p>The approach to GAHT differs and depends on
the developmental stage of the individual at the
time of initiation of hormone therapy as well as
their treatment goals. Hormone therapy is not recommended for children who have not begun
endogenous puberty. In eligible youth (as per
Chapter 6—Adolescents) who have reached the
early stages of puberty, the focus is usually to delay
further pubertal progression with gonadotropin
releasing hormone agonists (GnRHas) until an
appropriate time when GAHT can be introduced.
In these cases, pubertal suppression is considered
medically necessary. Eligible adults may initiate
GAHT if they fulfill the criteria as per Chapter
5—Assessment for Adults. In addition, health care
providers should discuss fertility goals and fertility
preservation procedures prior to initiating GAHT.
See Chapter 16—Reproductive Health.</p>
<p>GAHT with feminine embodiment goals typically consists of estrogen and an androgen-lowering
medication (Hembree et al., 2017). Although
there are anecdotal reports of progesterone use
for breast development and mood management,
there is currently insufficient evidence the potential benefits of progesterone administration outweigh the potential risks (Iwamoto, T’Sjoen et al.,
2019). Masculinizing GAHT typically consists of
testosterone. Both WPATH and the Endocrine
Society recommend monitoring levels of sex
hormones. While GAHT is customized to meet
the individual needs of the TGD person, typically
hormone levels are maintained at a concentration
sufficient to support good bone health and are
not supraphysiologic (Hembree et al., 2017; Rosen
et al., 2019).</p>
<p>In most cases, GAHT is maintained throughout
life. It is not known if doses of GAHT should be
reduced in older TGD people. Discontinuation of
hormone therapy may result in bone loss in TGD
individuals and will definitely do so in individuals
whose gonads have been removed (Wiepjes et al.,
2020). Routine primary care should also be performed (see Chapter 15—Primary Care).
Epidemiology studies have reported an increased
incidence of cardiovascular disease and venous
thromboembolism (VTE) in TGD people receiving
estrogen, most notably in older people and with
different preparations of GAHT (Irwig, 2018;
Maraka et al., 2017). TGD individuals treated with
testosterone may also have increased adverse cardiovascular risks and events, such as increased
myocardial infarction, blood pressure, decreased
HDL-cholesterol, and excess weight (Alzahrani
et al., 2019; Irwig, 2018; Kyinn et al., 2021). Health
care professionals (HCPs) should discuss lifestyle
and pharmacologic therapy with patients who are
at the highest risk of developing cardiovascular
disease (see Chapter 15—Primary Care).
Polycythemia is another disorder that may present
in TGD people taking testosterone (Antun et al.,
2020). Therefore, it is important to continuously
monitor for the development of conditions that
can be exacerbated by GAHT throughout life
(Hembree et al., 2017).</p>
<p>All the statements in this chapter have been
recommended based on a thorough review of
evidence, an assessment of the benefits and
harms, values and preferences of providers and
patients, and resource use and feasibility. In some
cases, we recognize evidence is limited and/or
services may not be accessible or desirable.</p>

<h2>Gender-Affirming Hormone Therapy in Youth<a href="hormone-therapy.html#gender-affirming-hormone-therapy-in-youth" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The following sections will discuss hormone therapy in TGD youth. Depending on the developmental stage of the youth, this hormone therapy
generally comprises two phases, namely pubertal
suppression followed by the addition of GAHT.
During the first phase, pubertal development is
halted to allow the youth to explore their gender
identity and embodiment goals to prepare for the
next phase, which may include GAHT. This section
will discuss the recommendations for the use of
gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists (GnRHas)
as well as alternate approaches to pubertal suppression and will be followed by recommendations for
GAHT. Sections that are applicable to youth and
adults will follow in the next section.</p>

<h2>Statement 12.1: We recommend health care professionals begin pubertal hormone suppression in eligible* transgender and gender diverse adolescents only after they first exhibit physical changes of puberty (Tanner stage 2).<a href="hormone-therapy.html#statement-12.1-we-recommend-health-care-professionals-begin-pubertal-hormone-suppression-in-eligible-transgender-and-gender-diverse-adolescents-only-after-they-first-exhibit-physical-changes-of-puberty-tanner-stage-2." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In general, the goal of GnRHa administration
in TGD adolescents is to prevent further development of the endogenous secondary sex characteristics corresponding to the sex designated at
birth. Since this treatment is fully reversible, it
is regarded as an extended time for adolescents
to explore their gender identity by means of an
early social transition (Ashley, 2019e). Treatment
with GnRHas also has therapeutic benefit since
it often results in a vast reduction in the level
of distress stemming from physical changes that
occur when endogenous puberty begins
(Rosenthal, 2014; Turban, King et al., 2020).</p>
<p>For those prepubertal TGD children who have
been persistent in their gender identity, any
amount of permanent development of secondary
sex characteristics could result in significant distress. While one might consider use of a GnRHa
to prevent initiation of puberty in such individuals
who remain at Tanner Stage 1, this use of GnRHa
has not been recommended (Hembree et al., 2017).
When a child reaches an age where pubertal development would normally begin (typically from 7-8
to 13 years for those with ovaries and from 9 to
14 years for those with testes), it would be appropriate to screen the child more frequently, perhaps
at 4-month intervals, for signs of pubertal development (breast budding or testicular volume &gt;
4 cc). Given the typical tempo of pubertal development (3.5–4 years for completion), it would be
very unlikely for permanent pubertal changes to
develop if one is only in puberty for 4 months or
less. Thus, with frequent follow-up, the initiation
of puberty can easily be detected before there are
irreversible physical changes, and GnRHa can be
started at that time with great efficacy. Of note,
following initiation of a GnRHa, there is typically
a regression of one Tanner stage. Thus, if there is
only Tanner stage 2 breast development, it typically
fully regresses to the prepubertal Tanner stage 1;
the same is typically true with Tanner stage 2
testes (often not even discernable to the patient
and is not associated with development of secondary sex characteristics).</p>
<p>Given GnRHas work through GnRH receptor
desensitization, if there’s no uptick in endogenous
GnRH stimulation of the pituitary (the first biochemical sign of puberty), there’s no need for
GnRH receptor desensitization. In addition,
because of the wide variability in the timing of
the start of puberty (as noted above), it is hard
to justify using a GnRHa that might have some
unknown risk if there’s no physiological benefit
before pubertal onset. Using a GnRHa with a
child at Tanner stage 1 would only be indicated
in cases of constitutional delay in growth and
puberty, likely alongside the start of GAHT.</p>
<p>However, the use of a GnRHa could be considered in a child who, due to a constitutional delay
in growth and puberty, starts GAHT while still in
Tanner Stage 1. Initiating GAHT may activate the
hypothalamic-pituitary gonadal axis in the beginning but may also mask the effects on the body
of this activation. To avoid body changes with the
potential to exacerbate an individual’s gender
incongruence, the GnRHa can be started as an
adjunctive therapy to the GAHT shortly after the
initiation of the GAHT to provide for pubertal
development of the identified phenotype.</p>
<p>In addition, the suppression of the development of secondary sex characteristics is most
effective when sex hormonal treatment is initiated
in early to mid-puberty when compared with the
initiation of sex hormonal treatment after puberty
is completed (Bangalore-Krisha et al., 2019).
Correspondingly, for adolescents who have already
completed endogenous puberty and are considering starting GAHT, GnRHas can be used to
inhibit physical functions, such as menses or
erections, and can serve as a bridge until the
adolescent, guardian(s) (if the adolescent is not
able to consent independently), and treatment
team reach a decision (Bangalore-Krishna et al.,
2019; Rosenthal, 2021).</p>
<p>The onset of puberty occurs through reactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.
Clinical assessment of the stages of puberty is
based on physical features that reflect that reactivation. In individuals with functioning ovaries,
Tanner stage 2 is characterized by the budding of
the mammary gland. The development of the
mammary gland occurs from exposure to estrogen
produced by the ovaries. In individuals with functioning testes, Tanner stage 2 is characterized by
an increase in testicular volume (typically greater
than 4ml). The growth of the testes is mediated
through the gonadotropins luteinizing hormone
(LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). In
the later stages, the testes produce enough testosterone to induce masculinization of the body.</p>

<p>GnRHas reduce gonadotrophin and sex steroid
concentrations in TGD adolescents and thus halt
the further development of secondary sex characteristics (Schagen et al., 2016). Their use is
generally safe with the development of hypertension being the only short-term adverse event
reported in the literature (Delemarre-van de Waal
&amp; Cohen-Kettenis, 2006; Klink, Bokenkamp et al.,
2015). GnRHas prevent the pituitary gland from
secreting LH and FSH (Gava et al., 2020). When
the gonadotropins decrease, the gonad is no longer stimulated to produce sex hormones (estrogens or androgens), and the sex hormone levels
in the blood decrease to prepubertal levels.
GnRHa treatment leads to partial regression of
the initial stages of the already developed secondary sex characteristics (Bangalore et al., 2019).
TGD adolescents with functioning ovaries will
experience diminished growth of breast tissue,
and if treatment is started at Tanner stage 2, the
breast tissue may disappear completely (Shumer
et al., 2016). Menarche can be prevented or discontinued following the administration of GnRHas
in adolescents with a uterus. In TGD adolescents
with functioning testes, testicular volume will
regress to a lower volume.</p>
<p>When GnRHa treatment is started in adolescents at the later phases of pubertal development,
some physical changes of pubertal development,
such as late-stage breast development in TGD
adolescents with functioning ovaries and a lower
voice and growth of facial hair in TGD adolescents with functioning testes, will not regress
completely, although any further progression will
be stopped (Delemarre-van de Waal &amp;
Cohen-Kettenis, 2006). GnRHas have been used
since 1981 for the treatment of central precocious
puberty (Comite et al., 1981; Laron et al., 1981),
and their benefits are well established (please also
see the statements in Chapter 6—Adolescents).
The use of GnRHas in individuals with central
precocious puberty is regarded as both safe and
effective, with no known long-term adverse
effects (Carel et al., 2009). However, the use of
GnRHas in TGD adolescents is considered
off-label because they were not initially developed
for this purpose. Nonetheless, data from adolescents prescribed GnRHas in a similar dose and
fashion demonstrate effectiveness in delaying the
onset of puberty although the long-term effects
on bone mass have not been well established
(Klink, Caris et al., 2015). Although long-term
data are more limited in TGD adolescents than
in adolescents with precocious puberty, data collection specifically in this population are ongoing
(Klaver et al., 2020; Lee, Finlayson et al., 2020;
Millington et al., 2020; Olson-Kennedy, Garofalo
et al., 2019).</p>
<p>We recognize even though GnRHas are a medically necessary treatment, they may not be available for eligible adolescents because it is not
covered by health insurance plans in some countries or may be cost-prohibitive. Therefore, other
approaches should be considered in these cases,
such as oral or injectable progestin formulations.
In addition, for adolescents older than 14 years,
there are currently no data to inform HCPs
whether GnRHas can be administered as monotherapy (and for what duration) without posing
a significant risk to skeletal health. This is because
the skeleton will not have any exposure to adequate levels of sex steroid hormones
(Rosenthal, 2021).</p>
<p>A prolonged hypogonadal state in adolescence,
whether due to medical conditions such as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, iatrogenic causes
such as GnRHa monotherapy or physiological
conditions such as conditional delay of growth
and development, is often associated with an
increased risk of poor bone health later in life
(Bertelloni et al., 1998; Finkelstein et al., 1996).
However, bone mass accrual is a multifactorial
process that involves a complex interplay between
endocrine, genetic, and lifestyle factors (Anai
et al., 2001). When deciding on the duration of
GnRHa monotherapy, all contributing factors
should be considered, including factors such as
pretreatment bone mass, bone age, and pubertal
stage from an endocrine perspective and height
gain, as well as psychosocial factors such as mental maturity and developmental stage relative to
one’s adolescent cohort and the adolescent’s individual treatment goals (Rosenthal, 2021). For
these reasons, a multidisciplinary team and an
ongoing clinical relationship with the adolescent
and the family should be maintained when initiating GnRHa treatment (see Statements 6.8, 6.9,
and 6.12 in Chapter 6—Adolescents). The clinical
course of the treatment, e.g., the development of
bone mass during GnRHa treatment and the adolescent’s response to treatment, can help to determine the length of GnRHa monotherapy.</p>

<p>Sex steroid hormone therapy generally comprises two treatment regimens, depending on the
timing of the GnRHa treatment. When GnRHa
treatment is started in the early stages of endogenous pubertal development, puberty corresponding with gender identity or embodiment goals is
induced with doses of sex steroid hormones similar to those used in peripubertal hypogonadal
adolescents. In this context, adult doses of sex
steroid hormones are typically reached over
approximately a 2-year period (Chantrapanichkul
et al., 2021). When GnRHa treatment is started
in late- or postpubertal transgender adolescents,
sex steroid hormones can be given at a higher
starting dose and increased more rapidly until a
maintenance dose is achieved, resembling treatment protocols used in transgender adults
(Hembree et al., 2017). An additional advantage
of GnRHa treatment is sex steroid hormones do
not have to be administered in supraphysiological
doses, which would otherwise be needed to suppress endogenous sex steroid production (Safer
&amp; Tangpricha, 2019). For TGD individuals with
functioning testes, GnRHa treatment (or another
testosterone-blocking medication) should be continued until such time as the TGD adolescent/
young adult ultimately undergoes gonadectomy,
if this surgical procedure is pursued as a medically necessary part of their gender-affirming
care. Once adult levels of testosterone are reached
in TGD individuals with functioning ovaries who
have been initially suppressed with GnRHa’s, testosterone alone at physiological doses is typically
sufficient to lower ovarian estrogen secretion, and
GnRHas can be discontinued as discussed below
(Hembree et al., 2017). For TGD adolescents with
functioning ovaries who are new to care, GAHT
can be accomplished with physiological doses of
testosterone alone without the need for concomitant GnRHa administration (Hembree et al., 2017).</p>
<p>Gender-affirming sex steroid hormone therapy
induces the development of secondary sex characteristics of the gender identity. Also, the rate
of bone mineralization, which decreases during
treatment with GnRHa’s, rapidly recovers (Klink,
Caris et al., 2015). During GnRHa treatment in
early-pubertal TGD adolescents, the bone epiphyseal plates are still unfused (Kvist et al., 2020;
Schagen et al., 2020). Following the initiation of
sex steroid hormone treatment, a growth spurt
can occur, and bone maturation continues (Vlot
et al., 2017). In postpubertal TGD adolescents,
sex steroid hormone treatment will not affect
height since the epiphyseal plates have fused, and
bone maturation is complete (Vlot et al., 2017).
In TGD adolescents with functioning testes,
the use of 17-ß-estradiol for pubertal induction
is preferred over that of synthetic estrogens, such
as the more thrombogenic ethinyl estradiol (see
Appendix D (Asscheman et al., 2015). It is still
necessary to either continue GnRHa’s to suppress
endogenous testosterone production or transition
to another medication that suppresses endogenous testosterone production (Rosenthal et al.,
2016). Breast development and a female-typical
fat distribution are among a number of physical
changes that occur in response to estrogen treatment. See Appendix C—Table 1.</p>
<p>For TGD adolescents seeking masculinizing
treatment, androgens are available as injectable
preparations, transdermal formulations, and subcutaneous pellets. For pubertal induction, the use
of testosterone-ester injection is generally recommended by most experts initially because of cost,
availability, and experience (Shumer et al., 2016).
It is advised to continue GnRHas at least until
a maintenance level of testosterone is reached. In
response to androgen treatment, virilization of
the body occurs, including a lowering of the
voice, more muscular development particularly
in the upper body, growth of facial and body
hair, and clitoral enlargement (Rosenthal et al.,
2016). See Appendix C—Table 1.</p>
<p>In almost all situations, parental/caregiver consent should be obtained. Exceptions to this recommendation, in particular when caregiver or
parental involvement is determined to be harmful
to the adolescent, are described in more detail
in Chapter 6—Adolescents (see Statement 6.11)
where the rationale for involving parents/caregivers in the consent process is also described.</p>

<p>Menstrual suppression is a treatment option
commonly needed by TGD individuals who experience distress related to menses or the anticipation of menarche. Statement 6.7 in Chapter
6—Adolescents describes this in more detail. To
achieve amenorrhea, menstrual suppression can
be initiated as a solo option before initiating testosterone or alongside testosterone therapy
(Carswell &amp; Roberts, 2017). Some youth, who are
not ready for testosterone therapy or are not yet
at an appropriate pubertal/developmental stage
to begin such treatment, will benefit from the
induction of amenorrhea (Olson-Kennedy,
Rosenthal et al., 2018). Adolescents who experience an exacerbation of dysphoria related to the
onset of puberty may elect to be treated with
GnRHas for pubertal suppression (also see the
Adolescents chapter).</p>
<p>Progestogens may be effective in adolescents
whose goal is solely menstrual suppression.
Continuous administration of progestin-only oral
pills (including the contraceptive and noncontraceptive options), medroxyprogesterone injections,
or levonorgestrel intrauterine device can be used
for induction of amenorrhea (Pradhan &amp;
Gomez-Lobo, 2019). TGD individuals with functioning ovaries who start testosterone therapy
may have 1–5 menstrual cycles before amenorrhea is achieved (Taub et al., 2020). Once amenorrhea is achieved, some TGD individuals with
functioning ovaries may also choose to continue
progestin treatment for birth control if relevant
to their sexual practices.</p>
<p>TGD individuals with functioning ovaries and
a uterus should be counseled about the potential
for breakthrough menstrual bleeding in the first
few months after initiating menstrual suppression.
With GnRHa therapy, breakthrough bleeding may
occur 2–3 weeks after initiation of the medication. For individuals seeking contraception or for
those who continue to experience menstrual
bleeding on progestin therapy, an estrogen combination with progestin may be considered for
the maintenance of amenorrhea, yet they should
be counseled on the possible side effect of breast
development (Schwartz et al., 2019).</p>

<h2>Statement 12.8: We recommend health care providers involve professionals from multiple disciplines who are experts in transgender health and in the management of the care of transgender and gender diverse adolescents.<a href="hormone-therapy.html#statement-12.8-we-recommend-health-care-providers-involve-professionals-from-multiple-disciplines-who-are-experts-in-transgender-health-and-in-the-management-of-the-care-of-transgender-and-gender-diverse-adolescents." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>As with the care of adolescents, we suggest
where possible a multidisciplinary expert team
of medical and mental health professionals
(MHPs) be assembled to manage this treatment.
In adolescents who pursue GAHT (given this is
a partly irreversible treatment), we suggest initiating treatment using a schedule of gradually
increasing doses after a multidisciplinary team
of medical and MHPs has confirmed the persistence of GD/gender incongruence and has
established the individual possesses the mental
capacity to give informed consent (Hembree
et al., 2017). Specific aspects concerning the
assessment of adolescents and the involvement
of their caregivers and a multidisciplinary team
are described in more detail in Chapter
6—Adolescents.</p>
<p>If possible, TGD adolescents should have access
to experts in pediatric transgender health from
multiple disciplines including primary care, endocrinology, fertility, mental health, voice, social
work, spiritual support, and surgery (Chen,
Hidalgo et al., 2016; Eisenberg et al., 2020;
Keo-Meier &amp; Ehrensaft, 2018). Individual providers are encouraged to form collaborative working
relationships with providers from other disciplines to facilitate referrals as needed for the
individual youth and their family (Tishelman
et al., 2015). However, the lack of available
experts and resources should not constitute a
barrier to care (Rider, McMorris et al., 2019).
Helpful support for adolescents includes access
to accurate, culturally informed information
related to gender and sexual identities, transition
options, the impact of family support, and connections to others with similar experiences and
with TGD adults through online and in person
support groups for adolescents and their family
members (Rider, McMorris et al., 2019).</p>
<p>Many TGD adolescents have been found to
experience mental health disparities and initial
mental health screening (e.g., PHQ-2, GAD) can
be employed as indicated (Rider, McMorris et al.,
2019). Providers should keep in mind being
transgender or questioning one’s gender does not
constitute pathology or a disorder. Therefore,
individuals should not be referred for mental
health treatment exclusively on the basis of a
transgender identity. HCPs and MHPs who treat
these youths and make referrals should, at a minimum, be familiar with the impact of trauma,
gender dysphoria, and gender minority stressors
on any potential mental health symptomatology,
such as disordered eating, suicidal ideation, social
anxiety. These health care providers should also
be knowledgeable about the level of readiness of
inpatient mental health services in their region
to provide competent, gender-affirming care to
TGD youth (Barrow &amp; Apostle, 2018; Kuper,
Wright et al., 2018; Kuper, Mathews et al., 2019;
Tishelman &amp; Neumann-Mascis, 2018). Statements
6.3, 6.4, and 6.12d in Chapter 6—Adolescents
address this in more detail. Because parents of
these youth commonly experience high levels of
anxiety immediately after learning their youth is
TGD, and their response to their child predicts
that child’s long-term physical and mental health
outcomes, appropriate referrals for mental health
support of the parents can be of great utility
(Coolhart et al., 2017; Pullen Sansfaçon et al.,
2015; Taliaferro et al., 2019).</p>

<p>Sex steroid hormone therapy is associated with
a broad array of physical and psychological
changes (Irwig, 2017; Tangpricha &amp; den Heijer,
2017) (see Appendix C—Table 1). After sex steroid hormone therapy has been initiated, the
HCP should regularly assess the progress and
response of the individual to the treatment (also
see Chapter 6—Adolescents). This evaluation
should assess the presence of any physical changes
as well as the impact of treatment on gender
dysphoria (if present) and psychological well-being
(see Appendix C—Table 1). Clinical visits provide
important opportunities for HCPs to educate
patients about the typical time course required
for physical changes to manifest and encourage
realistic expectations. During the first year of
hormone therapy, sex steroid hormone doses are
often increased. A major factor guiding the dose
is the serum level of the corresponding sex steroid hormone. In general, the goal is to target
serum levels of the sex steroids to match the
levels associated with the individual’s gender
identity, although optimal target ranges have not
been established (Hembree et al., 2017).</p>
<p>In addition to assessing the positive changes
associated with sex steroid hormone therapy, the
HCP should regularly assess whether the treatment has caused any adverse effects (see Appendix
C—Table 2). Examples of adverse signs and
symptoms include androgenic acne or bothersome
sexual dysfunction (Braun et al., 2021; Kerckhof
et al., 2019). GAHT also has the potential to
adversely influence several laboratory tests. For
example, spironolactone may cause hyperkalemia,
although it is an uncommon and transient phenomenon (Millington et al., 2019). Testosterone
increases the red blood cell count (hematocrit),
which may occasionally cause erythrocytosis
(Antun et al., 2020) (see Statement 12.17)
(Hembree et al., 2017). Both estrogen and testosterone can alter lipid parameters, such as
high-density protein lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides (Maraka et al., 2017). See
Appendix C—Tables 3 and 4.</p>
<p>The frequency of clinical evaluations should
be individualized and guided by the individual’s
response to treatment. We suggest clinical assessments be performed approximately every 3
months during the first year of hormone therapy
in patients who are stable and are not experiencing significant adverse effects (Appendix C—Table
5). We suggest rather than recommend testing
be carried out every 3 months in the first year
to allow some flexibility on the timing of these
tests as there is no strong evidence or evidence
from published studies supporting specific testing
intervals. If an individual does experience an
adverse effect, more frequent laboratory testing
and/or clinical visits are often needed. Given the
potential harm associated with sex hormone levels that exceed expected ranges in humans, we
strongly recommend regular testing be performed
as a standard practice when initiating GAHT in
TGD individuals. Once a person has reached a
stable adult dose of sex steroid hormone with no
significant adverse effects, the frequency of clinic
visits can be reduced to one to two per year
(Hembree et al., 2017).</p>

<p>Pubertal suppression and hormone treatment
with sex steroid hormones may have potential
adverse effects on a person’s future fertility
(Cheng et al., 2019) (see also Chapter 6—
Adolescents and Chapter 16—Reproductive
Health). Although some TGD people may not
have given much thought to their future reproductive potential at the time of their initial
assessment to begin medical therapy, the potential
implications of the treatment and fertility preservation options should be reviewed by the hormone prescriber and discussed with the person
seeking these therapies (Ethics Committee of the
American Society for Reproductive Medicine
et al., 2015; De Roo et al., 2016).</p>
<p>Individuals with testes should be advised prolonged treatment with estrogen often causes
testicular atrophy and a reduction in sperm count
and other semen parameters (Adeleye et al.,
2018). Nonetheless, there are major gaps in
knowledge, and findings regarding the fertility of
trans feminine people who take estrogen and
antiandrogens are inconsistent (Cheng et al.,
2019). In one study, heterogeneity in testicular
histology was evident whether patients discontinued or continued therapy prior to orchiectomies (Schneider et al., 2015). For example, the
discontinuation of estrogen and antiandrogens for
six weeks resulted in complete spermatogenesis
in 45% of individuals with the remainder showing
meiotic arrest or spermatogonial arrest (Schneider
et al., 2015). However, serum testosterone levels
confirmed to be within female reference ranges
leads to complete suppression of spermatogenesis
in most transgender women (Vereecke et al.,
2020). The principal fertility preservation option
for patients with functioning testes is sperm cryopreservation, also known as sperm banking
(Mattawanon et al., 2018). For prepubertal
patients, suppression of puberty with GnRHs
pauses the maturation of sperm (Finlayson
et al., 2016).</p>
<p>Individuals with functioning ovaries should
be advised testosterone therapy usually results
in the cessation of menses and ovulation, often
within a few months of initiation (Taub et al.,
2020). There are also major gaps in knowledge
regarding the potential effects of testosterone
on oocytes and subsequent fertility of TGD
patients (Eisenberg et al., 2020; Stuyver et al.,
2020). One study found testosterone treatment
may be associated with polycystic ovarian morphology, whereas other studies reported no
metabolic (Chan et al., 2018) or histologic (De
Roo et al., 2017; Grynberg et al., 2010) evidence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
following treatment with testosterone, and some
studies have found a pre-existing higher prevalence of PCOS in transgender patients with
ovaries (Baba, 2007; Gezer et al., 2021). TGD
patients with an intact uterus and ovaries often
regain their fertility potential if testosterone
therapy is discontinued (Light et al., 2014).
Indeed, a live birth after assisted reproductive
technology has been reported following
hormone-stimulated egg retrieval from a TGD
individual who did not discontinue testosterone
therapy (Greenwald et al., 2021; Safer and
Tangpricha, 2019). Other fertility preservation
options for TGD patients with ovaries are
oocyte cryopreservation and embryo cryopreservation with sperm from a partner or donor.
The above options require hormonal stimulation for egg retrieval and the use of assisted
reproductive technology.</p>
<p>For early pubertal transgender youth, suppression of puberty with GnRHa’s pauses the maturation of germ cells, although a recent report
noted ovarian stimulation of a TGD adolescent
treated with a GnRHa’s in early puberty (and
continued during ovarian stimulation) resulted in
a small number of mature oocytes that were cryopreserved (Rothenberg et al., 2019). Treating an
TGD adolescent with functioning testes in the
early stages of puberty with a GnRHa not only
pauses maturation of germ cells but will also
maintains the penis in a prepubertal size. This
will likely impact surgical considerations if that
person eventually undergoes a penile-inversion
vaginoplasty as there will be less penile tissue to
work with. In these cases, there is an increased
likelihood a vaginoplasty will require a more
complex surgical procedure, e.g., intestinal vaginoplasty (Dy et al., 2021; van de Grift et al.,
2020). Such considerations should be included in
any discussions with patients and families considering use of pubertal blockers in early pubertal
adolescents with functioning testes.</p>

<p>TGD people seeking masculinization must be
informed about the possibilities, consequences,
limitations, and risks associated with testosterone
treatment. Testosterone therapy is contraindicated
during pregnancy or while attempting to become
pregnant given its potential iatrogenic effects on
the fetus. Relative contraindications to testosterone therapy include severe hypertension, sleep
apnea, and polycythemia since these conditions
can be exacerbated by testosterone. Monitoring
blood pressure and lipid profiles should be performed before and after the onset of testosterone
therapy. The increase in blood pressure typically
occurs within 2 to 4 months following the initiation of testosterone therapy (Banks et al.,
2021). Patients who develop hypercholesterolemia
and/or hypertriglyceridemia may require treatment with dietary modifications, medication,
or both.</p>
<p>TGD people seeking feminizing treatment
with a history of thromboembolic events, such
as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, should undergo evaluation and treatment
prior to the initiation of hormone therapy. This
is because estrogen therapy is strongly associated
with an increased risk of thromboembolism, a
potentially life-threatening complication. In
addition, risk factors that can increase the risk
of thromboembolic conditions, such as smoking,
obesity, and sedentary lifestyle, should be modified. In patients with nonmodifiable risk factors,
such as a known history of thrombophilia, a
past history of thrombosis, or a strong family
history of thromboembolism, treatment with
transdermal estrogen concomitant with anticoagulants may decrease the risk of thromboembolism. However, there are limited data to guide
treatment decisions. The presence of a disease
at baseline such as a hormone sensitive cancer,
coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease,
hyperprolactinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and
cholelithiasis should be evaluated prior to the
initiation of gender-affirming hormone therapy
as relative risks may be shifted in association
with exogenous hormone treatment (Hembree
et al., 2017).</p>

<p>The effects of testosterone treatment are multiple and may include the appearance of increased
body and facial hair, male pattern baldness,
increased muscle mass and strength, decreased
fat mass, deepening of the voice, interruption of
menses (if still present), increased prevalence and
severity of acne, clitoral enlargement, and
increased sexual desire (Defreyne, Elaut et al.,
2020; Fisher, Castellini et al., 2016; Giltay &amp;
Gooren, 2000; T’Sjoen et al., 2019; Yeung et al.,
2020). Other testosterone-associated changes
include increased lean body mass, skin oiliness,
(de Blok et al., 2020; Hembree et al., 2017; Kuper,
Mathews et al., 2019; Taliaferro et al., 2019;
Tishelman &amp; Neumann-Mascis, 2018) (see
Appendix C—Table 1).</p>
<p>Estrogen treatment induces breast development.
However, fewer than 20% of individuals reach
Tanner breast stages 4–5 after 2 years of treatment (de Blok et al., 2021). Additional changes
include decreases in testicular volume, lean body
mass, skin oiliness, sexual desire, spontaneous
erections, facial hair, and body hair along with
increased subcutaneous body fat) (see Appendix
C—Table 1). In adult patients, estrogen does not
alter a person’s voice or height (Iwamoto, Defreyne
et al., 2019; Wiepjes et al., 2019).
The time course and extent of physical changes
vary among individuals and are related to factors
such as genetics, age of initiation, and overall
state of health (Deutsch, Bhakri et al., 2015; van
Dijk et al., 2019). Knowledge of the extent and

<p>Determining the safest and most efficacious
estrogen compound and route of administration
for TGD people is an important topic. The recommended estrogen-based regimens are presented
in Appendix C—Table 4. The Amsterdam Medical
Center (AMC) first reported 45 events of VTE
occurring in 816 transgender women, notably an
expected incidence ratio of VTE 20-fold higher
than that reported in a reference population (van
Kesteren et al., 1997). Following this report, the
AMC clinic recommended the use of transdermal
estradiol for transgender women older than 40
years of age, which subsequently lowered the
incidence of VTE (Nota et al., 2019; Toorians
et al., 2003). Other studies suggested ethinyl
estradiol is associated with a higher risk of blood
clotting due to an increased resistance to the
anticoagulating effects of activated protein C
(APC) and elevated concentrations of the clotting
factors protein C and protein S (Toorians et al.,
2013). Other studies published within the past
15 years from other clinics reported transgender
women taking other forms of estrogen had lower
rates of VTE than transgender women taking
ethinyl estradiol (Asscheman et al., 2013).
Furthermore, a 2019 systematic review concluded
ethinyl estradiol administration was associated
with the highest risk of VTE in transgender
women, while an association between progesterone use and VTE was also identified (Goldstein
et al., 2019).</p>
<p>The 2017 Endocrine Society guidelines did not
recommend conjugated equine estrogens (CEEs)
as a treatment option because blood levels of
conjugated estrogens cannot be measured in
transgender women making it difficult to prevent
supraphysiologic dosing of estrogen and thereby
increasing the potential risk of VTE (Hembree
et al., 2017). A retrospective study from the UK
examined the risks of oral CEE versus oral estradiol valerate versus oral ethinyl estradiol and
found up to a 7-fold increase in the percentage
of transgender women in the oral CEE group
who developed VTE compared with transgender
women using other forms of estrogen (Seal et al.,
2012). In a nested, case-control study, over 80,000
cisgender women aged 40–79 who developed a
VTE were matched to approximately 390,000 cisgender women without VTE; the results showed
oral estradiol use had a lower risk of VTE than
conjugated estrogens, and transdermal estrogen
was not associated with an increased risk of VTE
(Vinogradova et al., 2019).</p>
<p>A systematic review evaluated several formulations of estrogen and identified a retrospective
and a cross-sectional study that made head-tohead comparisons of the risks associated with
different formulations (Wierckx, Mueller et al.,
2012; Wierckx et al., 2013). No identified studies
evaluating the risk of different formulations of
estrogen employed a prospective interventional
design. The retrospective study examined 214
transgender women taking transdermal estradiol
(17β-estradiol gel 1.5 mg/d or estradiol patch
50 mcg/d) or a daily intake of oral estrogens
(estradiol 2 mg/d, estriol 2 mg/d, ethinyl estradiol
50 mcg/day, or ethinyl estradiol 30–50 mcg in an
oral contraceptive) (Wierckx et al., 2013). Within
a 10-year observation period, 5% of the cohort
developed a VTE, 1.4% (3 of 214) experienced
a myocardial infarction (MI), and 2.3% (5 of 214)
a transient ischemic attack or cerebrovascular
accident (TIA/CVA). The prevalence of VTE, MI
and TIA/CVA was increased following the initiation of estrogen therapy. However, the authors
did not report differences between regimens of
estrogen in terms of these endpoints.</p>
<p>The same group of investigators conducted a
cross-sectional study that examined 50 transgender women (mean age 43 ± 10) taking oral estrogen (estradiol valerate 2 mg/d, estriol 2 mg/d or
ethinyl estradiol 50–120 mcg/day) or using transdermal estradiol (17β-estradiol 1.5 mg/day or
estradiol 50 mcg/day) over a follow-up duration
of 9.2 years (Wierckx, Mueller et al., 2012).
Twelve percent (n = 6) developed either a VTE,
MI, or a TIA/CVA. Two of the participants were
taking conjugated estrogen 0.625 mg/d (one person in combination with cyproterone acetate), 2
participants were taking ethinyl estradiol
20–50 mcg/d, 1 was taking cyproterone acetate
50 mg/d, while the estrogen regimen used by the
sixth participant was not defined. None of the
subjects taking oral estradiol or transdermal
estradiol developed a VTE, MI, or TIA/CVA.</p>
<p>One prospective study examined the route of
estrogen administration in 53 transgender women
in a multicenter study carried out throughout
Europe. Transgender women younger than 45
years of age (n = 40) received estradiol valerate
4mg/d in combination with cyproterone acetate
(CPA) 50mg/d and transgender women older than
45 years of age (n = 13) received transdermal
17β-estradiol, also with CPA. No VTE, MI, or
TIA/CVA was reported after a 1-year follow-up in
either the oral or transdermal estrogen group. An
additional retrospective study from Vienna found
no occurrences of VTE among 162 transgender
women using transdermal estradiol who were followed for a mean of 5 years (Ott et al., 2010).</p>
<p>We are strongly confident in our recommendation against the use of ethinyl estradiol based on
historical data from the Amsterdam clinic demonstrating a reduction in the incidence of VTE after
discontinuing the use of ethinyl estradiol and the
recent systematic review demonstrating an increased
risk of VTE in transgender women taking ethinyl
estradiol (Weinand &amp; Safer, 2015). We are confident
in our recommendation against the use of CEE
based on the 2012 study by Seal et al. demonstrating an increased risk of VTE in transgender women
taking CEE compared with other formulations of
estrogen and with data from cisgender women on
hormone replacement therapy (Canonico et al.,
2007; Seal et al., 2012). Prospective and retrospective studies in transgender women have reported
occurrences of VTE/MI/CVA only in those taking
CEE or ethinyl estradiol. Since estradiol is inexpensive, more widely available, and appears safer
than CEE in limited studies, the committee recommends against using CEE when estradiol is an
available treatment option. The quality of studies
may be limited to prospective, cohort or
cross-sectional study designs; however, the stronger
level of recommendation is based on the consistent
evidence supporting the association between the
use of ethinyl estradiol and CEE and a greater risk
of VTE/MI/CVA in transgender women.
We are also confident in our recommendation
for the administration of transdermal preparations of estrogen in older transgender women
(age &gt; 45 years) or those with a previous history
of VTE. The confidence in our recommendation
is based on the decreased incidence of VTE
reported from the Amsterdam clinic when transgender women are switched to using transdermal
preparations after age 40 (van Kesteren et al.,
1997). Furthermore, the prospective, multicenter
cohort study ENIGI found no incidence of VTE/
MI/CVA in transgender women who are routinely
switched to transdermal estrogen at age 45
(Dekker et al., 2016). In addition, a study by Ott
et al. demonstrated no incidence of VTE in 162
transgender women treated with estradiol patches
(Ott et al., 2010).</p>
<p>With the exception of cyproterone acetate (note
this is not approved for use in the US because
of concerns of potential hepatotoxicity), the use
of progestins in hormone therapy regimens
remains controversial. To date, there have been
no quality studies evaluating the role of progesterones in hormone therapy for transgender
patients.</p>
<p>We are aware some practitioners who prescribe
progestins, including micronized progesterone,
are under the impression there may be improvements in breast and/or areolar development,
mood, libido, and overall shape for those seeking
it along with other benefits yet to be demonstrated (Deutsch, 2016a; Wierckx, van Caenegem
et al., 2014). However, these improvements remain
anecdotal, and there are no quality data to support such progestin use. An attempted systematic
review we commissioned for this version of the
SOC failed to identify enough data to make a
recommendation in favor of any progestins.
Instead, existing data suggest harm is associated
with extended progestin exposure (Safer, 2021).</p>
<p>For cisgender women who have a uterus, progestins in combination with estrogens are necessary to avoid the endometrial cancer risk
associated with the administration of unopposed
estrogen. For cisgender women who do not have
a uterus, progestins are not used. The best data
for the concerns related to progestin use come
from comparisons between the above two cisgender populations, which we acknowledge is not
necessarily generalizable to this population.
Although not definitive of a class effect for all
progestins, medroxyprogesterone added to
combined equine estrogens is associated with
greater breast cancer and cardiac risks (Chlebowski
2020; Manson, 2013). It is important to note data
from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) studies
may not be generalizable to transgender populations. Compared with the cisgender women in
the studies, transgender populations seeking hormone therapy tend to be younger, do not use
equine estrogen, and hormone therapy in these
cases address current mental health and quality
of life and not solely risk prevention
(Deutsch, 2016a).</p>
<p>Potential adverse effects of progestins include
weight gain, depression, and lipid changes.
Micronized progesterone may be better tolerated
and may have a more favorable impact on the
lipid profile than medroxyprogesterone (Fitzpatrick
et al., 2000). When paired with estrogens for
transgender women, the progestin cyproterone
acetate is associated with elevated prolactin,
decreased HDL cholesterol, and rare meningiomas—none of which are seen when estrogens are
paired with GnRH agonists or spironolactone
(Bisson, 2018; Borghei-Razavi, 2014; Defreyne,
Nota et al., 2017; Sofer et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Thus, data to date do not include quality evidence supporting a benefit of progestin therapy
for transgender women. However, the literature
does suggest a potential harm of some progestins,
at least in the setting of multi-year exposure. If,
after a discussion of the risks and benefits of progesterone treatment, there is a collaborative decision to begin a trial of progesterone therapy, the
prescriber should evaluate the patient within a year
to review the patient’s response to this treatment.</p>

<h2>Statement 12.16: We recommend health care professionals prescribe testosterone-lowering medications (either cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, or GnRH agonists) for eligible* transgender and gendered diverse people with testes taking estrogen as part of a hormonal treatment plan if their individual goal is to approximate levels of circulating sex hormone in cisgender women.<a href="hormone-therapy.html#statement-12.16-we-recommend-health-care-professionals-prescribe-testosterone-lowering-medications-either-cyproterone-acetate-spironolactone-or-gnrh-agonists-for-eligible-transgender-and-gendered-diverse-people-with-testes-taking-estrogen-as-part-of-a-hormonal-treatment-plan-if-their-individual-goal-is-to-approximate-levels-of-circulating-sex-hormone-in-cisgender-women." class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Most gender clinics in the US and Europe prescribe estrogen combined with a
testosterone-lowering medication (Mamoojee
et al., 2017) (see Appendix C—Table 5). In the
US, spironolactone is the most commonly prescribed testosterone-lowering medication, while
GnRHas are commonly used in the UK, and
cyproterone acetate are most often prescribed in
the rest of Europe (Angus et al., 2021; Kuijpers
et al., 2021). The rationale for adding a
testosterone-lowering medication is two-fold 1)
to lower testosterone levels to within the reference range of cisgender women; and 2) to reduce
the amount of estrogen needed to achieve adequate physical effects. Each testosterone-lowering
medication has a different side effect profile.
Spironolactone is an antihypertensive and
potassium-sparing diuretic, and thus may lead to
hyperkalemia, increased frequency of urination,
and a reduction in blood pressure (Lin et al.,
2021). Cyproterone acetate has been associated
with the development of meningioma and hyperprolactinemia (Nota et al., 2018). GnRHa’s, while
very effective in lowering testosterone levels, can
result in osteoporosis if doses of estrogen given
concurrently are insufficient (Klink, Caris
et al., 2015).</p>
<p>One systematic review identified one study that
reported findings from a head-to-head comparison of the testosterone-lowering medications
cyproterone acetate and leuprolide (Gava et al.,
2016). Two studies compared a group of transgender women taking estrogen plus
testosterone-lowering medications with a group
who received only estrogen. The systematic
review did not provide sufficient evidence to suggest any of the three testosterone-lowering medications had a better safety profile in terms of
improved outcomes in bone health, testosterone
levels, potassium levels, or in the incidence of
hyperprolactinemia or meningiomas (Wilson
et al., 2020). Therefore, no recommendation can
be given. There view did report
spironolactone-based regimens were associated
with a 45% increase in prolactin levels, whereas
cyproterone-based regimens increased prolactin
levels by more than 100%. However, the clinical
significance of elevated prolactin levels is not
clear because the rates of prolactinomas were not
significantly elevated in either the spironolactoneor CPA-treated groups (Wilson et al., 2020). One
retrospective, cohort study from a single center
in the US reported no clinically significant
increases in prolactin levels in 100 transgender
women treated with estrogen plus spironolactone
(Bisson et al., 2018). A retrospective study from
the Netherlands of 2,555 transgender women taking primarily CPA with various formulations of
estrogen reported an increased standardized incidence ratio of meningiomas in patients who used
cyproterone acetate after gonadectomy for many
years when compared with the general Dutch
population (Nota et al., 2018). Furthermore, in
a shorter study in Belgium, 107 transgender
women had transient elevations in prolactin levels
following treatment with cyproterone acetate,
which declined to normal after discontinuation
(Defreyne, Nota et al., 2017). A recent publication, not included in the systematic review, examined 126 transgender women taking spironolactone,
GnRHas, or cyproterone and concluded cyproterone was associated with higher prolactin levels
and a worse lipid profile than spironolactone or
GnRHas (Sofer et al., 2020). After balancing the
costs and accessibility of measuring prolactin levels against the clinical significance of an elevated
level, a decision was made not to make a recommendation for or against monitoring prolactin
levels at this time. HCPs should therefore make
individualized clinical decisions about the necessity to measure prolactin levels based on the type
of hormone regimen and/or the presence of
symptoms of hyperprolactinemia or a pituitary
tumor (e.g., galactorrhea, visual field changes).</p>
<p>Cyproterone has also been linked to meningiomas. Nine cases of meningioma have been
reported in the literature among transgender
women primarily taking cyproterone acetate
(Mancini et al., 2018). This increased risk has also
been identified in cisgender populations. In 2020,
the European Medicines Agency published a report
recommending cyproterone products with daily
doses of 10 mg or more should be restricted
because of the risk of developing meningioma
(European Medicines Agency, 2020). Most likely
this association is a specific effect of cyproterone
acetate and has not been extrapolated to include
other testosterone-lowering drugs. In the US,
where cyproterone acetate is not available, the
North American Association of Central Cancer
Registries (NAACCRs) database did not identify
an increased risk of brain tumors (not specific to
meningiomas) among transgender women (Nash
et al., 2018). Furthermore, there was not an
increase in the hazard ratio of brain tumors in
the Kaiser cohort of 2,791 transgender women
compared with cisgender controls (Silverberg et al.,
2017). No long-term studies have reported on the
risk of meningiomas and prolactinomas in transgender women taking GnRHas.</p>
<p>Our strong recommendation for the use of
testosterone-lowering medications as part of a
hormone regimen for transgender individuals
with testes is based on the global practice of
using these medications in addition to estrogen
therapies as well as the relatively minimal risk
associated with these therapies. However, we are
not able to make a recommendation favoring
one testosterone-lowering medication over
another at this time. The published data thus
far raises some concerns about the risk of
meningiomas with the prolonged use (&gt;2 years)
and higher doses (&gt;10mg daily) of cyproterone
acetate (Nota et al., 2018; Ter Wengel et al.,
2016; Weill et al., 2021).</p>
<p>Bicalutamide is an antiandrogen that has been
used in the treatment of prostate cancer. It competitively binds to the androgen receptor to block
the binding of androgens. Data on the use of
bicalutamide in trans feminine populations is
very sparse and safety data is lacking. One small
study looked at the use of bicalutamide 50 mg
daily as a puberty blocker in 23 trans feminine
adolescents who could not obtain treatment with
a GnRH analogue (Neyman et al., 2019). All adolescents experienced breast development which is
also commonly seen in men with prostate cancer
who are treated with bicalutamide. Although rare,
fulminant hepatotoxicity resulting in death has
been described with bicalutamide (O’Bryant et al.,
2008). Given that bicalutamide has not been adequately studied in trans feminine populations, we
do not recommend its routine use.</p>
<p>The administration of 5α-reductase inhibitors
block the conversion of testosterone to the more
potent androgen dihydrotestosterone. The Food
&amp; Drug Administration (FDA) approved indications of finasteride administration include benign
prostatic hypertrophy and androgenetic alopecia.
Data on the use of 5α-reductase inhibitors in
trans feminine populations is very sparse (Irwig,
2021). It is unclear whether this class of medication could have any clinical benefit in trans
feminine individuals whose testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels have already been lowered
with estrogen and an antiandrogen. We therefore
do not recommend their routine use in trans
feminine populations. Finasteride may be an
appropriate treatment option in trans masculine
individuals experiencing bothersome alopecia
resulting from higher dihydrotestosterone levels.
Nonetheless, treatment with a 5α-reductase inhibitor may impair clitoral growth and the development of facial and body hair in trans masculine
individuals. Studies are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of 5α-reductase inhibitors in
transgender populations.</p>

<p>There are good quality data suggesting a rise
in hematocrit (or hemoglobin) is associated with
TGD persons treated with testosterone (Defreyne
et al., 2018). The testosterone regimens in the systematic review included testosterone esters ranging
from the equivalent of 25–250mg SC/IM weekly,
testosterone undecanoate 1000mg every 12 weeks,
or testosterone gel 50mg applied daily to the skin
(Defreyne et al., 2018; Gava et al., 2018; Giltay

2014; T’Sjoen et al., 2005; Wierckx, van Caenegem

The expected rise should be consistent with reference ranges in cisgender males.</p>

<p>Despite the absence of evidence, perioperative
clinical standards for gender-affirmation surgeries
have included cessation of hormone therapy for
1–4 weeks before and after surgery, most commonly genital surgeries (Hembree et al., 2009).
Such practice was meant to mitigate the risk of
VTE associated with exogenous estrogen administration (Hembree et al., 2009). Estrogen and
testosterone could then be resumed at some point
postoperatively.</p>
<p>After careful examination, investigators have
found no perioperative increase in the rate of
VTE among transgender individuals undergoing
surgery, while being maintained on sex steroid
treatment throughout when compared with that
among patients whose sex steroid treatment was
discontinued preoperatively (Gaither et al., 2018;
Hembree et al., 2009; Kozato et al., 2021; Prince
&amp; Safer, 2020). Sex steroid treatment is especially
important after gonadectomy to avoid the sequelae
of hypogonadism, the risk of developing osteoporosis, and for the maintenance of mental health
and quality of life (Fisher, Castellini et al., 2016;
Rosen et al., 2019). Thus, hormone providers and
surgeons should educate patients about the necessity for continuous exogenous hormone therapy
after gonadectomy.</p>
<p>To be able to educate patients and serve as
clinical advocates, HCPs should be knowledgeable
about the risks and benefits of gender-affirmation
surgeries and should also be cognizant of the
performance measures and surgical outcomes of
the surgeons to whom they might refer patients
(Beek, Kreukels et al., 2015; Colebunders et al.,
2017; Wiepjes et al., 2018). In general, most medically necessary surgeries can be thought of as
involving three regions: the face, chest/breasts,
and genitalia (internal and external). Additional
medically necessary procedures include body contouring and voice surgery. See medical necessity
statement in Chapter 2—Global Applicability,
Statement 2.1).</p>
<p>Multiple procedures are available for facial
gender-affirming surgeries including, but not limited to chondrolanryngoplasty, rhinoplasty, contouring or augmentation of the jaw, chin, and
forehead, facelift, hair removal and hair transplantation (see Chapter 13—Surgery and
Postoperative Care). Procedures available for
chest/breast surgery include breast augmentation,
double mastectomy with nipple grafts, periareolar
mastectomy, and liposuction. The most common
gender-affirmation surgery for TGD individuals
with endogenous breast development is masculinizing chest surgery (mastectomy) (Horbach
et al., 2015; Kailas et al., 2017).</p>
<p>Internal genital surgery procedures include but
are not limited to orchiectomy, hysterectomy,
salpingo-oophorectomy, vaginoplasty, and colpectomy/vaginectomy (Horbach et al., 2015; Jiang
et al., 2018). The inner lining in vaginoplasty is
typically constructed from penile skin, skin grafts,
a combination of both, or a bowel segment.
Removal of the uterus/ovaries can be performed
individually or all at once (hysterectomy,
salpingo-oophorectomy, and colpectomy). If
colpectomy is performed, a hysterectomy must
also be performed. The ovaries may remain in
situ, upon patient request. A potential benefit of
leaving one or both ovaries is fertility preservation, while the downside is the potential for the
development of ovarian pathology, including cancer (De Roo et al., 2017).</p>
<p>External genital surgery procedures include but
are not limited to vulvoplasty, metoidioplasty, and
phalloplasty (Djordjevic et al., 2008; Frey et al.,
2016). Hair removal is generally necessary before
performing external genital procedures (Marks
et al., 2019). Vulvoplasty can include the creation
of the mons, labia, clitoris, and urethral opening.
Urethral lengthening is an option for both
metoidioplasty and phalloplasty, but is associated
with a greatly increased complication rate
(Schechter &amp; Safa, 2018). Wound care and physical therapy are necessary for managing wounds
resulting from the donor sites for phalloplasty
(van Caenegem, Verhaeghe et al., 2013). Pelvic
physical therapy can also be an important adjunct
intervention after surgery for managing voiding
and sexual function (Jiang et al., 2019). Dialogue,
mutual understanding, and clear communication
in a common language between patients, HCPs,
and surgeons will contribute to well-considered
decisions about the available surgical procedures.</p>

<p>Several mental health disparities have been
documented in the transgender population
including depression, suicidality, anxiety,
decreased self-esteem, and post-traumatic stress
disorder (Arcelus et al., 2016; Becerra-Culqui et
al, 2018; Bouman et al., 2017; Eisenberg et al.,
2017; Heylens, Elaut et al., 2014; Witcomb et al.,
2018). The gender minority stress model provides evidence of several mediators and moderators of these disparities (Hendricks &amp; Testa,
2012; Meyer, 2003). Mediators and moderators
of mental health disparities unique to transgender people include experiences of discrimination,
victimization, misgendering, family rejection, and
internalized transphobia (Hendricks &amp; Testa,
2012). Factors that have a positive effect on mental health include family acceptance, supportive
social and romantic relationships, transgender
community connectedness, protection by affirming and inclusive policies, policies of affirmation
and inclusion, possession of updated legal name/
gender documentation, and achievement of physical gender transition based on individualized
embodiment goals (Bauer et al., 2015; Bockting
et al., 2013; Bouman et al., 2016; Davey et al.,
2014; de Vries et al., 2014; Du Bois et al., 2018;
Gower, Rider, Brown et al., 2018; Hendricks &amp;
Testa, 2012; Keo-Meier et al., 2015; Meier et al.,
2013; Pflum et al., 2015; Ryan et al., 2010; Smith
et al., 2018).</p>
<p>Hormone therapy has been found to positively
impact the mental health and quality of life of
TGD youth and adults who embark on this treatment (Aldridge et al., 2020; Allen et al., 2019;
Bauer et al., 2015; Nobili et al., 2018; Russell
et al., 2018; Ryan, 2009). In many cases, hormone
therapy is considered a lifesaving intervention
(Allen et al., 2019; Grossman &amp; D’Augelli, 2006;
Moody et al., 2015). Several studies have found
associations between the initiation of hormone
therapy and improved mental health in youth
and adults (Aldridge et al., 2020; Costa et al.,
2016; de Vries et al., 2014; Kuper et al., 2020;
Nguyen et al., 2018; White Hughto &amp; Reisner,
2016), including improvements in quality of life
(Gorin-Lazard et al., 2012; Gorin-Lazard et al.,
2013; Murad et al., 2010; Newfield et al., 2006;
Nobili et al., 2018; White Hughto &amp; Reisner,
2016), a reduction in anxiety and depression
(Aldridge et al., 2020; Colizzi et al., 2014; Davis
&amp; Meier, 2014; de Vries, Steensma et al., 2011;
Gómez-Gil et al., 2012; Rowniak et al., 2019),
decreased stress, and decreased paranoia
(Keo-Meier &amp; Fitzgerald, 2017). A prospective,
controlled trial using the Minnesota Multiphasic
Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) demonstrated
significant improvement in multiple domains of
psychological functioning in transgender men
after only 3 months of testosterone treatment
(Keo-Meier et al., 2015). Although there are
higher rates of autism symptoms in the transgender population, these symptoms have not been
found to increase after the initiation of hormone
therapy (Nobili et al., 2020).</p>
<p>As a reduction in depressive symptoms may
correlate with a decrease in the risk of suicide,
withholding hormone therapy based on the presence of depression or suicidality may cause harm
(Keo-Meier et al., 2015; Levy et al., 2003). Turban,
King et al. (2020) found a decrease in the odds
of lifetime suicidal ideation in adolescents who
required pubertal suppression and had access to
this treatment compared with those with a similar
desire with no such access (Turban, King et al.,
2020). A recent systematic review found pubertal
suppression in TGD adolescents was associated
with an improved social life, decreased suicidality
in adulthood, improved psychological functioning
and quality of life (Rew et al., 2020). Because evidence suggests hormone therapy is directly linked
to decreased symptoms of depression and anxiety,
the practice of withholding hormone therapy until
these symptoms are treated with traditional psychiatry is considered to have iatrogenic effects
(Keo-Meier et al., 2015). If psychiatric treatment
is indicated, it can be started or adjusted concurrently without discontinuing hormone therapy.
